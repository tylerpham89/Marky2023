With swift response times and a proactive approach, we secure the best talent out there. Unlock your company's true potential! 💪🌟 #RecruitmentRevolution #EmbraceExcellence",Chapter 3 Speed is what matters.,"I remember like it yesterday. I had landed a giant recruitment contract. But I did not know I was not the only recruitment company with the contract. They also contracted with one of my biggest competitors. 
The big company had more people and more resources, and they were using them to beat me out for all the placements. I was in the fight of my business life. They did not like me being there and were determined to push me out. I needed to make placements, or I would lose the contract, and the big company would win. 

So I decided I would use the shotgun approach. I upped my advertising budget again and did a text message campaign for the candidates that were on my list (candidates I own). It kind of worked, and kind of didn’t work... here is what I mean. The number of candidates that responded to our job posting & text message campaign increased.   

But the number of people we hired only increased for some recruiters and not others. The strange thing I noticed about the results is. I would have 2 recruiters with the same skill set and get two wildly different results from them. You would think the results would be similar to each other. It was frustrating...I suspected that something was up. If I could solve this puzzle, I could easily double my profits with the same number of resources, ad spend, and effort I am using now.  

I started searching for any study, report, or any bit of creditable information on what would cause such a difference in performance with two equally skilled recruiters. I read article after article clicking link after link in the articles for what seemed like weeks until I finally ended up finding a study by Harvard business review. I found a study on sales companies' response rates 
 

Our research shows that most companies are not responding nearly fast enough… our research indicates that many firms are too slow to follow up on these leads. We audited 2,241 U.S. companies…. 24% took more than 24 hours—and 23% of the companies never responded at all. The average response time…. was 42 hours.  
These results are especially shocking given how quickly online leads go cold. Firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times as likely to qualify the lead….as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later—and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer.”’ 
Source: Harvard Business Review 
https://timetoreply.com/harvard-business-review/ 
 
The first time I read the report, I thought it had valuable information. And I put the report in my file to read again. I continued my search, but I could not find anything that useful. A few weeks passed, and I picked up the Harvard business review report to read it again. When I finished reading the report, I came to a different conclusion. Have you ever experienced that? You get a different message from the same report or book on a different read. 

This time reading the report, I realized the variable for success was not the sales skill of the salesperson. The variable for success was the speed at which the salesperson responded to the lead. Only after the salesperson was talking to a prospect did the sales skill come into play. 

I wondered if that was happening with my recruitment team. It would explain the discrepancy between the two recruiters with similar skills. With these market conditions, candidates rule the hiring process. Who knows. First, I needed to know how fast we respond to new candidates. To do that, we had to pull reporting from our phone system. And reporting from our hire-up funnel software and cross reference that will the call report to get the full picture. We broke it down by each recruiter extension and transfer.  

Here is what we uncovered each recruiter handled their new candidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason on how my recruiters responded to the new canidates they received from our advertising.  As we studied the data, a pattern started to emerge. We cross-referenced that with the placements report, and my suspicions were confirmed.  

Some of our recruiters responded to new canidates on the day they applied and they filled a lot more jobs than the recruiters that responded the following day or the following two days. There was a direct correlation between how fast a call, text, or resume was responded to by a recruiter. And the total number of people hired by that recruiter. 

The Harvard Business Review Report proved to ring true in recruiting candidates from the Internet. This means we lost a lot of candidates, which cost a lot of money. And wasted a lot of our recruiter's time following up trying to get these canidates on the phone to qualify. All because we delayed responding to new canidates one day. Is your team doing the same thing?  

Section 1 Ghosting Canidates 

That reminded me of a project we did for a client. They were having all kinds of issues with their hiring. So we did a survey of all the candidates they did not hire, and the results were eye-opening 30% of the candidates said that the recruiter ghosted them. Almost half of the ghosted candidates said it happened more than two times.    
 
This damaged their employer's brand. And can have a negative effect on future candidates from applying. It is critical that candidate ghosting does not happen. And adequate and appropriate feedback given to job seekers. No matter what stage of the hiring process they are in.    
 
Reshaping recruitment and retention is all about human interaction. It is not just about AI or an online experience; it has a human element. So, you must integrate human interaction with technology and AI to achieve the greatest results, hybrid AI. I worked with the team to determine the best way to respond to new candidates from our advertising. After weeks of trial and error. We tested different timelines on hundreds of new candidates from our advertising.   
 
AI crunched the data and showed that if we returned our candidates' first call. Text, application or resume within 15 minutes. We were six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. The team agreed that 15 minutes was a reasonable time to respond. So that became the new business rule.    
 
Section 2 Check & Balance:  

After that experience, I realized I needed a check and balance system. To ensure that my recruiters were treating each and every candidate the same. And the system informs the management team when business processes are not being followed. Or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure you do not miss a hiring deadline. To carry out this. We use check and balance rules in the workflow that could not be possible without automation with decision logic.    
 
Having check and balance rules in Hire up Funnels was an eye-opening experience for me. Before we put our check and balance in the workflow. We had no way to measure how our recruitment team followed up with canidates. Just like most of you.    
 
I did not know how long it took our recruiters to respond to new candidates from our advertising. Or if they were getting ghosted, It was like flying blind. With our check and balance rules. You will know if all your business’s best practices and recruitment rules are followed. Ensuring recruiter efficacy and good candidate experience. like flying with instruments, you know if you are on course or not, so you can correct and get back on track.    
 
Here is how the check and balance rules work. If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. Call a candidate back within 15 min of receiving a new candidate. The check and balance workflow would send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task and e-mail. Ensure a prompt callback and make sure the new candidate is not ghosted.    
 
Suppose this happens two times in a row. And the candidate is not called within the time limit of our business rules. In that case, the workflow sends a notification to the assigned recruitment manager. Who can then figure out why the new candidate. That you spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules. For the highest advertising-to-interview conversion ratio.    
 
Ensuring all candidates get a great experience. You are more productive; you hire more of the qualified candidates you are already talking to. The Hire Up funnels workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate. So, you hire more of the qualified canidates you are already talking to. Never worry if your team is not following best practices and rules. Our check and balance rules will keep you informed.   

After giving our team the information and tools to improve their results. Our team now has an average 5-minute response time to new candidates from our advertising. All recruiters have increased the number of hires. Some so much that you would not believe me if I shared them with you. Check and balance rules can carry out various tasks. We use several versions throughout our Hire Up Funnels.   
 
Section 3 Follow up programmed in check and balance rules.    
 
I wanted to beat the big company for the most placements badly. I dug a little deeper in the data and started to see a new pattern. I shared it with the team, and they confirmed it. When a candidate calls, text, or submit a resume. And if the call went to voicemail or a text was not returned, that started a domino effect of complications. The most time-consuming was the never-ending game of phone tag. To get the candidate back on the phone or respond to your text so you could activate. And start the recruitment process of qualification.    
 
I returned to my Hire up Funnels software and pulled reporting of follow-up attempts. To successful calls where we got the candidate on the phone to do the prescreening call to qualify. And move to the next stage of the recruitment cycle success path. 
 
The results were like the new candidate from advertising results. Every recruiter handled the new canidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason for how many follow-up calls a recruiter made. Everyone on the team had a different number of follow-up calls. We shared the results with the team. The high-performing recruiters made more follow-up calls than the low-performer ones. The report told us that 20% of the team gave up after only two follow-up attempts. That was disappointing...   
 
I shared the results with the team to see the best way to fix this. The recruiters that responded with the least number of follow-up calls. Shared some very valuable information with us. The main reason for not making as many follow-up calls. Was that they felt like they were pestering the candidates. And felt like they were being pushy. I can understand that.    
 
So, the big question was. How many times should candidates be called for the best contact, qualification, and hiring ratios? And so, your team knows the number of calls to make that they are not bothering candidates. So, we tested the candidates we had. To see the correct number of follow-ups. To get a candidate that responded to our job advertisement. On the phone who did not answer the recruiters' first return call.   
 
We tested calling, texting, and sending e-mails, and pixel targeting. It was surprising to learn that you must do much more follow-up than one would think for a job.  But you do not want to overdo it, burn out your candidates, and destroy your reputation in your market. The sweet spot is to be persistent but not a stalker. The stats told us that we needed to follow up seven. To eight times to get a candidate activated on the phone (without upsetting them). To do a prescreen call and qualify.    
 
Digging even deeper into the data. We also discovered that if we did not get the candidate on the phone in the first seven days after applying with us. They went cold and non-responsive. The tests we ran told us we got more people on the phone to prescreen. And qualify if we used a combination of phone calls and text messages, and e-mails.    
 
On a fluke my lead recruiter suggested that we try using our AI chatbot in our follow-up messages. To give our canidates the option to use the AI chatbot to book time to talk to the recruiter, and boy, did they.   
 
Section 4 Follow-up rules.    
 
We added follow-up rules to our check and balance workflow with that data. When the recruiter calls the new candidate back, the call is unanswered. We have a control requiring eight follow-ups for every new candidate not activated. The recruiter calls the candidate every other day for eight days. When the recruiter does not call. We set up the workflow to send our omnichannel communication.    
 
This way, we reach out to our candidate eight times in six days. With four calls from the recruiter and four automated Omni channel communication. Including AI chatbots, to schedule a call with a recruiter. Increasing the efficiency of our recruitment team. Getting more people on the phone. And into the qualification stage of the recruitment cycle.    
 
If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. The workflow would automatically send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task in their calendar and e-mail. If your recruiter does not adhere to the follow-up rules. Another reminder task is sent if this happens twice in a row. The candidate is not called within the time frame of our business rules. Then the workflow sends a notification. To the assigned recruitment manager. Who can figure out why the new candidate. That we spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules time frame.    
 
 
Ensure all candidates have a great recruitment experience. And we are more productive, so we hire more of the qualified candidates we are already talking to. The recruitment funnel workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate.  
 
Section 5 Conclusion 
 
Here is how important a good candidate's experience is. According to career plug. 80% of candidates said that a positive candidate experience influenced their decision to say yes to an offer. 58% of job seekers said that a poor candidate experience led them to decline a job.    
https://www.careerplug.com/blog/improve-hiring-with-better-communication/  
 
So, I adjusted my funnel with the check and balance rules of 15 min to return a call. And programed eight follow ups for every new candidate and relaunched it. Did some optimization and the team started to hire more people. We started to beat the big company for placements. With the same resources I was spending before I made the changes to the check and balance rules. It was an all-out war for the top spot. One week they would take the top spot, and the next week, we would take the top spot. This went on for several weeks, the competition was fierce. It was technology strategy versus strength, who would win?    
 
With a dedicated team and the right tools. We were able to track, measure and optimize our recruitment funnels. To become number one, we held the top spot to the end of the recruitment contract. Technology strategy wins over strength every time...    
 
Success is achieved by adjusting technology. To accommodate human behavior opened a whole new world for me. What else can I do to gain market advantage? So, I studied the biggest technology companies. To figure out how they grew so fast and became market leaders.   
 
Remember, there is something much bigger at play here than just data. As the data increases and the metrics become more trackable, It is easy to get sucked into the analytics of it all. And in the process, forget that there is a person on the other side of the metrics. A person with a problem, a person who needs you to solve their problem.

Like a 'goto' statement in coding, let's value attention to detail. Embrace focus and determination to achieve your goals! #Inspiration #AttentionToDetail",,"First, by looking at the code as it is, we can see this ctrl_key member under ctrl, which is extracted from the dhchap_ctrl_secret member of host.

If there is a problem while extracting this key (checking for errors), ctrl_key is reassigned to NULL and then logs something to the kernel logs based on struct members under ctrl_key.

Um… What? Reassigning ctrl_key to NULL and dereferencing it to print its value to log? Alright, that’s clearly a problem, and if we compare this piece of code to the rest of the code in this function, we can simply see that there is a missing goto statement for handling the invalid ctrl_key, which is a mistake. However, is it even exploitable?

Exploiting NVMe bug
One of the prime things we need to know while researching a big project (like the Linux kernel) is not to get too carried away. There are plenty of functions and features we can delve into that aren’t relevant to the thing we’re researching. Focus is key here.

Following the logic above, if we are to see how we can exploit the bug, we shouldn’t necessarily be deep-diving into how the NVMe protocol works. Instead, we can try to see how to reach the vulnerable code with minimum effort.

As observable from the vulnerable code snippet (nvmet_setup_auth), the name of the vulnerable function is nvmet_setup_auth, which stands for setting up the authentication for something – but what exactly?

NVMe-sources

Figure 2: NVMe sources

By tinkering around the code base, we see that two objects keep showing up: host and target. From a quick search on mighty Google and looking around the code base, we can understand that host stands for the client of the NVMe and target stands for the server (where the storage is) so that the target (server) will expose the NVMe storage to the hosts (clients).

nvme-topology

Figure 3: NVMe Topology

Since the code we’re looking at is in auth.c under the target code directory, this code might be reachable while connecting to the server (target) – but how exactly?

According to the LWN article about this new authentication feature, the first attempt to implement the feature was for NVMe-TCP – “… and seeing that it provides some real benefit especially for NVMe-TCP here’s an attempt to implement it…”.

As we learned what NVMeoF is, we can assume this code is reachable via a TCP connection! But first, let’s verify it by viewing the code (open-source FTW).

nvmet-setup-auth-callstack

Figure 4: nvmet_setup_auth call stack

If we go up the call stack of nvmet_setup_auth, we can see that we’re getting into a function called nvmet_req_init, which initiates and assigns multiple variables to the req variable.
multiple variables to the req variable.

bool nvmet_req_init(struct nvmet_req *req, struct nvmet_cq *cq,
    struct nvmet_sq *sq, const struct nvmet_fabrics_ops *ops)
{
  u8 flags = req->cmd->common.flags;
  u16 status;
  req->cq = cq;
  req->sq = sq;
  req->ops = ops;
  req->sg = NULL;
    ...
}
nvmet_req_init.c

If we look at where req comes from, we can see that it is implementation dependent – meaning, it depends on the protocol of the NVMeoF we’re using. And indeed, we can see the TCP implementation over there!

nvme-of implementation

Figure 5: NVMe-oF implementation

Going up the call stack of the NVMe-TCP implementation, under nvmet_tcp_try_recv_pdu, the call for kernel_recvmsg made it even more compelling.

static int nvmet_tcp_try_recv_pdu(struct nvmet_tcp_queue *queue)
{
    ...
  iov.iov_base = (void *)&queue->pdu + queue->offset;
  iov.iov_len = queue->left;
  len = kernel_recvmsg(queue->sock, &msg, &iov, 1,
      iov.iov_len, msg.msg_flags);
  if (unlikely(len < 0))
    return len;
    ...
}
nvmet_tcp_try_recv_pdu.c

To prove that the bug is triggerable remotely, we need to test it, and for that, we will have to prepare a working environment. By searching once again in the fountain of knowledge – Google — we can easily find documentation on creating a working NVMe environment, even specifically for NVMe-TCP.

On the other hand, for finding out how to configure the new authentication feature, the search was way more complex. Eventually, I encountered the GitHub repository of the test framework for the Linux kernel block layer and storage stack – blktests, which helped me create my very own NVMe-TCP setup script for debugging.

Don't forget the power of personal interactions. Prioritize genuine connections that unlock endless possibilities! #HumanConnection #Inspiration #HR #Recruiting #DataDrivenRecruitment,Introduction,"Picture this: A time in the not-so-distant future where job applications are screened, shortlisted, interviewed, and hired, not by human beings, but by artificial intelligence. Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.

Revolutionize your multicultural transportation recruitment process with our advanced recruitment engine. #AIRecruitment #FutureOfWork,Chapter 4: Sales Machine ,"Section 0 Where it all started.  
Have you ever felt that life was happening for you instead of to you? Where, out of nowhere. You meet the love of your life or a business partner or are exposed to an ideal that changes your life. You did not do anything… life brought it to you. I was lucky enough to have that happen to me on September 14th, 1992. I was at 303 2nd Street, 5th floor in San Francisco, California.  
It was the first day of work at my dream job in advertising. Wanting to start strong, I started working on a list of businesses that did not advertise with us. Trying to drum up some new business. I scheduled an appointment with a company to meet at my office the next day. He showed up disheveled looking, wearing a stained shirt with old shoes. I thought, what did I get myself into?  We went to the conference room, and I got to know him and his business. It turns out he is one of San Francisco's biggest restauranteurs (never judge a book by its cover). He owned most of the restaurants in fisherman wharf, and the crab stands on the sidewalk. We spent most of the day together. When we were done, we put together some great advertising campaigns. 
He required a lot of extra work from me, like creating a process map of how the advertising would be handled. I had to set up tracking phone numbers. And document what ads had what unique phone number. So we can track which advertising campaign generated the lead. And he followed who would receive the lead and the outcome of the lead. So, he could do an ROI on his ad spend.    
 
The first year I did this for this client, I hated it. Setting up remote call forwarding tracking phone numbers sucked. It took forever on the phone with the phone company. I felt like I was doing a bunch of work the customer should be doing. But I was young and in my ignorance. I thought my job was to create great advertising campaigns to make the phone ring with leads. And it was the customer's job to turn the calls from the advertising into a sale.   

In my second year at the company, they changed the compensation plan. Overnight it changed the game. Advertising results have become more important than your sales results. Many top salespeople took it on the chine. Lots of their big sales from the previous year were cancelled.
The restauranteur customer I hated doing the extra work for. He was my biggest client this year. It was renewal time. I thought to myself. Watch it be my luck that the client gave me the numbers to keep my job last year. Cancels this year, and I got let fired because I could not make up the lost revenue.  So, I made him my first appointment; that way, I had time to try and recover if it went sideways and he canceled. I did not have access to the call reporting numbers or the call outcomes the customer did. So the first question I asked was, how do the numbers look? 
Section 2 

After a long pause, he got excited and shared with me the call report. And what he did with the call information. And how the calls were routed to reservations, and when a table was reserved, he used that for verification of sale. Then he shared the average ticket per table and how many times he turned tables throughout the day. He explained that if the servers sold high-profit items. Like desserts or bottled water to 10% of the tables, he would make another 20% return on his advertising.    
 
He whipped up all the data like his head chief that makes the cioppino his restaurants are famous for. And created what he called his sales machine. He was a six-sigma black belt and explained that his sales machine came from manufacturing. But instead of manufacturing and having an assembly line where you're creating widgets. You're manufacturing and have an assembly line where you are creating customers. I was hooked at first sight. It was the first time I had seen the sales process visually.    
 
Then he told me he was making $5.00 for every dollar he spent on advertising. Needless to say, he did not cancel his advertising. There was proof of the results; with that proof his sales machine, I could sell him the expanded advertising program I had set up. That sale pushed me over the top, and I earned one of the coveted top sales awards that year. And almost every year I worked there, all because of my customer’s sales machine.

When I entered the recruitment industry. I used the sales machine I learned from my advertising client. To build my first recruitment company. To over a million dollars in sales in the first six months in business. After a couple of years, I was able to buy my way out of corporate America and went to work at the recruitment company full-time.    
 
The first thing I did was go to work adjusting my sales machine. To accommodate the recruitment process. Instead of manufacturing and having an assembly line where you're creating customers. Like the sales machine. You're manufacturing and have an assembly line where you are creating successful employees. And reasons for them to say.    
 
I have gone through several different versions of the recruitment engine over the last two decades. I made adjustments dictated by the market conditions. And I also made improvements from what I learned working on my growth marketing certification from Digital Marketer. If you want to know about digital marketing. I highly recommend Ryan Deiss and the team at Digital Marketer.    
 
The recruitment engine is how I manufacture and produce qualified candidates. To be hired repeatably and predictively. It is a visual representation of how candidates are created. So, you can reduce the time it takes to fill a position. Streamline the application process. Improve the candidate's experience. So you lose fewer candidates as they go through the six stages of the recruitment cycle. Automate repetitive tasks for the recruiter efficiently. To free up time for more critical work. Like getting more of the qualified candidates your recruiter talks to, to your job offer. So, your team has a better chance of making the right job-to-candidate match. And you have a high-performing employee.

Section 3 Growth Marketing   

What I discovered when studying the success of the world's biggest technology companies that have become market leaders. They have attributed their success to one thing. Their skill at exploiting growth marketing, or they call it hacking growth, to produce network effects. That’s the one skill that enabled them to become market leaders.   
 
Growth marketers or growth hackers are the people who are responsible for all the functions that improve business revenue. This can include everything from acquiring new customers and turning them into repeat purchasers. And re-engaging the clients that drop out of the sales process. And bring them back to complete the sale, to find new ways to re-engage former clients to buy again. And ways to convert visitors who did not buy to new customers.  
 
Growth marketing or growth hacking's goal is. Not to achieve linear growth by increasing the workforce. Instead, growth is achieved by removing bottlenecks or friction in your technology. That produces small wins compounded over time. You are ultimately turning small improvements into landslide competitive advantages. And the more you continue to make small improvements. The more efficient and valuable your recruitment and retention technology becomes. It’s kind of like compounded interest in your retirement account. The longer you do it, the more it multiplies and increases in value.  
 
This is accomplished by marrying creativity with data analysis, marketing, and messaging. It works because your decisions stay rooted in data. At the same time, you still apply creativity. And curiosity while surveying your candidates. And your talent acquisition team at critical steps of the process.  They use a growth engine to guide the improvements.
 
Network effects occur when the value of your technology increases as its number of users grows. Network effects are among the most important reasons you pick one product or service over another. This growth engine technology strategy is moving from sales. And the marketing side of the business. To the recruitment and retention side of the business. I adapted this process to my recruitment and retention technology strategy.  I created a recruitment engine That turns small improvements in the candidate's experience. Into landslide recruitment advantages, creating network effects.
 

It works through a feedback loop. Whereby small wins compounded over time strengthen the recruitment and retention process. That produces market-shifting advantages. That are not easy for the competition to knock off. Which is precisely what we are looking for. The outcomes are that technology is strengthened as improvements are made. So more of your candidates make it to your job offer. 

Now just a small improvement in hires every month. Is a massive improvement after a year. Multiply that over the years you are in business, and the advantages are market shifting. The benefits you will have when you do this are not easy for the competition to knock off. Your recruitment engine creates an extra barrier to entry from competitors. Trying to poach your recruitment and retention strategy or, worse… your employees.  
 
The longer you improve, the more attractive your company's employer brand. And recruitment messaging becomes creating even more intrinsic value. Positioning you as the employer of choice. That drives even more candidates toward your job offer. And that only continues your landslide advantage in the talent market.  

The world event that guided our path was the use of growth marketing. According to LinkedIn, Growth is so important right now. The growth marketing manager role is the No. 1 fastest-growing job in Canada and France. In the United States, head of revenue operations (definitely a growth role) tops the list. And three countries — India, Mexico, and the United Kingdom — listed the head of growth or chief growth officer among its top 10, at the time of the writing of this book.  
 
As you can see, this growth engine strategy is being adopted in all types of businesses worldwide. It requires a skill set that most people just don’t have. Companies that are not using this growth engine strategy. Are scrambling to hire people who can execute it to grow their company. Why? Because it works.   
 
This is the human strategy side of our Hybrid AI. That is reshaping recruitment and retention. So if you only execute an AI strategy. Without the human strategy of growth marketing, you will never experience the network effect. HR departments are following the lead of enterprise-sized companies. In adapting this strategy with their technology. We are entering a time when we can no longer set up a recruitment technology strategy and forget it again. It is complex, and then you add AI to the mix, which adds a whole new level of complexity; I understand I have been in your shoes. I will make it as simple for you as I can.   

Section 4 Introduce the recruitment engine. 
I bet you have never heard of a recruitment engine. Or know what a recruitment engine is? 

The creation of a recruitment engine. A recruitment engine is my customer's sales machine strategy. And the growth engine strategy from growth marketing. I combined those strategies and created a recruitment engine. It is the documented stages of the candidate's recruitment journey to your job offer. To create a funnel map of all conversion points to the job offer. 
 
We document the digital journey to identify friction and bottlenecks. If removed will give a better recruitment experience to your candidates. So fewer of them fall out as they move through the six stages of the recruitment cycle, and more qualified candidates will make it to your job offer. Getting you more hires and the most significant return for your time, effort, and investment. A recruitment engine is also the visual representation of your candidates' journey to your job offer. It starts when a candidate responds to an open job. And ends when the job offer is accepted or denied. Your company's recruitment cycle.    
 
Your recruitment engine also serves the purpose of the visual representation we will give the higher-ups to get the project approval. We will use our recruitment engine as evidence to support our claim. To show the benefits of doing the project. And the recruitment engine will also show you the consequences. Of not solving your recruitment and retention problem. It will highlight the parts of the recruitment process that are going well. And the areas that could be going better. To highlight bottlenecks and friction causing you to lose qualified candidates.  
 
To create your recruitment engine, we document your candidate's journey to your job offer. The six different stages in the candidate's experience. We do that with a tool I created, the recruitment cycle success path. The recruitment cycle success path is a series of stages that guide candidates. Through the recruitment experience with your company, from application to job offer. The stages in the candidate's experience make up your company’s recruitment engine.  
 
You break down each stage of the recruitment lifecycle into two experiences. The technology experience and the messaging experience. They have different objectives. But overlap and must be congruent to produce high-performing employees. So, let's go ahead and map the bottlenecks. And friction in the candidate’s technology experience. I will be going into some explanation of the messaging strategy to give context. To how all of the moving parts work together. My book, Reshaping Recruitment, Transformation of Employer Branding with AI and Advanced Automation, covers my complete messaging strategy. Based on Maslow’s needs theory, so our messaging talks to our candidates, not at them.  
________________________________________
Section 5 Recruitment Cycle Success Path.  
The recruitment cycle comprises four main milestones. Your candidate goes through on their journey to employment with your company. These milestones are: Welcome, Activate, Diagnose & Qualify, Prescribe & Job Offer, then after they are hired, they stop the recruitment life cycle and enter a new phase with the company. The employee life cycle. The process is simple. Straightforward and easy to understand for your candidates and the talent acquisition team.   
 
 
Section 1: Welcome    
 
Your new candidates enter the Welcome Stage. After they have been exposed to your job advertising or were sourced by your team. And are interested in learning more about the position. So they call, submit a resume or fill out an online application and become traffic you own. The candidates that your recruitment team did not talk to are moved to the activation stage.   
 
Section 2: Activate   
 
Most new canidates will land in the Activate stage. Because applicants would rather fill out a mini application or submit a resume than a call about the job. That causes the first bottleneck to get that canidates to your job offer. When a new candidate fills out an application or online form, your canidates automatically go into the activation stage. Because Your team must go through the extra work of following up to get your canidates on the phone to qualify. 

This is where most businesses stop and miss out on a great chance to build a relationship. This stage can also be a nurturing phase of the recruitment cycle to establish trust. And delivers value to build relationships with your candidates. Candidates can be moved into the activation stage. At different points in the recruitment cycle, they fall out.
 
Section 3: Diagnose & Qualify   
 
In this stage of the recruitment cycle. You start the prescreening with questions intended to determine if the candidate is qualified for the position. These questions are designed to diagnose not only a person's ability and skills. But also their career goals and ensure they align with company values. If the candidate is qualified, they move to the Prescribe & Job Offer Section. If not qualified, depending on the reason. They can go onto an alternative path to employment, or we choose not to recruit.   

Section 4: Prescribe & Job Offer    
 
In this stage, the outcome depends on the results of the interview. If you decide they are qualified. You want to make a job offer to get them on-boarded and start on their career path with your company. If they are not qualified now. You can prescribe an alternative path to employment if qualified.   
 
This is where the recruitment cycle ends. And the employee lifecycle starts. 

Section 5: Conclusion
In this journey, we have navigated the challenges of the trucking and logistics industry, understood the potential of AI in recruitment, and shared the transformative experience of a recruitment engine. We've learned from influential books and big tech and seen how AI can give businesses a competitive edge that's more crucial than ever in today's cutthroat market.
The decision to embrace AI in recruitment is no longer optional; it's a necessity. Faced with an acute driver shortage, companies must rethink their recruitment strategies. Hybrid AI offers not just an efficient recruitment process but a strategic tool. A recruitment engine that improves the quality of hire, enhances retention and ultimately impacts a company’s reputation and growth.
The book ""Hacking Growth "" and the network effect further underscore this truth. They illuminate the transformative power of Hybrid AI and the perils of clinging to outdated methods. The message is clear: There's no room for speculation or stagnation in the relentless pursuit of a competitive edge.
AI doesn't sleep; it constantly learns, adapts, and improves, working tirelessly to give your company the competitive edge it needs to succeed. It's time to step into the future of recruitment to use data-driven methods to attract and retain the best talent.
There’s an AI revolution unfolding, reshaping recruitment and retention. The choice is yours: to be part of the revolution and thrive, or ignore it and risk becoming irrelevant.
Action Steps:
1.	Research: Explore various AI-powered recruitment tools available in the market. Look for features relevant to your business, like data processing capacity, and industry-specific solutions.
2.	Evaluate: Consider your current recruitment process. Identify areas where AI could bring efficiency, reduce speculation, and enhance results.
3.	Invest: Commit to adopting an AI-powered recruiter and use your recruitment engine to make your recruitment more efficient. It's not just a purchase but an investment in your company's future.
4.	Review and refine: Regularly review your recruitment process and software. Look for areas of improvement and optimize their usage for better results creating the network effect.
In conclusion, the driver shortage in the trucking and logistics industry is a complex issue but not an insurmountable one. With the AI-powered recruiter, hybrid AI and a recruitment engine, you can redefine recruitment, solve talent acquisition challenges, and gain the competitive edge you need to thrive. The future of recruitment is here. Embrace it.",1,2023-08-15T23:34:00.167892,3,1,,1,0,2023-08-12T15:58:09.271370,False,promotional,handshake-meme-prompt

By embracing AI and automation, we're revolutionizing the hiring process to provide a more personalized and efficient experience. Say goodbye to impersonal interactions and hello to a brighter future of successful hiring!",Chapter 3 Speed is what matters.,"I remember like it yesterday. I had landed a giant recruitment contract. But I did not know I was not the only recruitment company with the contract. They also contracted with one of my biggest competitors. 
The big company had more people and more resources, and they were using them to beat me out for all the placements. I was in the fight of my business life. They did not like me being there and were determined to push me out. I needed to make placements, or I would lose the contract, and the big company would win. 

So I decided I would use the shotgun approach. I upped my advertising budget again and did a text message campaign for the candidates that were on my list (candidates I own). It kind of worked, and kind of didn’t work... here is what I mean. The number of candidates that responded to our job posting & text message campaign increased.   

But the number of people we hired only increased for some recruiters and not others. The strange thing I noticed about the results is. I would have 2 recruiters with the same skill set and get two wildly different results from them. You would think the results would be similar to each other. It was frustrating...I suspected that something was up. If I could solve this puzzle, I could easily double my profits with the same number of resources, ad spend, and effort I am using now.  

I started searching for any study, report, or any bit of creditable information on what would cause such a difference in performance with two equally skilled recruiters. I read article after article clicking link after link in the articles for what seemed like weeks until I finally ended up finding a study by Harvard business review. I found a study on sales companies' response rates 
 

Our research shows that most companies are not responding nearly fast enough… our research indicates that many firms are too slow to follow up on these leads. We audited 2,241 U.S. companies…. 24% took more than 24 hours—and 23% of the companies never responded at all. The average response time…. was 42 hours.  
These results are especially shocking given how quickly online leads go cold. Firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times as likely to qualify the lead….as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later—and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer.”’ 
Source: Harvard Business Review 
https://timetoreply.com/harvard-business-review/ 
 
The first time I read the report, I thought it had valuable information. And I put the report in my file to read again. I continued my search, but I could not find anything that useful. A few weeks passed, and I picked up the Harvard business review report to read it again. When I finished reading the report, I came to a different conclusion. Have you ever experienced that? You get a different message from the same report or book on a different read. 

This time reading the report, I realized the variable for success was not the sales skill of the salesperson. The variable for success was the speed at which the salesperson responded to the lead. Only after the salesperson was talking to a prospect did the sales skill come into play. 

I wondered if that was happening with my recruitment team. It would explain the discrepancy between the two recruiters with similar skills. With these market conditions, candidates rule the hiring process. Who knows. First, I needed to know how fast we respond to new candidates. To do that, we had to pull reporting from our phone system. And reporting from our hire-up funnel software and cross reference that will the call report to get the full picture. We broke it down by each recruiter extension and transfer.  

Here is what we uncovered each recruiter handled their new candidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason on how my recruiters responded to the new canidates they received from our advertising.  As we studied the data, a pattern started to emerge. We cross-referenced that with the placements report, and my suspicions were confirmed.  

Some of our recruiters responded to new canidates on the day they applied and they filled a lot more jobs than the recruiters that responded the following day or the following two days. There was a direct correlation between how fast a call, text, or resume was responded to by a recruiter. And the total number of people hired by that recruiter. 

The Harvard Business Review Report proved to ring true in recruiting candidates from the Internet. This means we lost a lot of candidates, which cost a lot of money. And wasted a lot of our recruiter's time following up trying to get these canidates on the phone to qualify. All because we delayed responding to new canidates one day. Is your team doing the same thing?  

Section 1 Ghosting Canidates 

That reminded me of a project we did for a client. They were having all kinds of issues with their hiring. So we did a survey of all the candidates they did not hire, and the results were eye-opening 30% of the candidates said that the recruiter ghosted them. Almost half of the ghosted candidates said it happened more than two times.    
 
This damaged their employer's brand. And can have a negative effect on future candidates from applying. It is critical that candidate ghosting does not happen. And adequate and appropriate feedback given to job seekers. No matter what stage of the hiring process they are in.    
 
Reshaping recruitment and retention is all about human interaction. It is not just about AI or an online experience; it has a human element. So, you must integrate human interaction with technology and AI to achieve the greatest results, hybrid AI. I worked with the team to determine the best way to respond to new candidates from our advertising. After weeks of trial and error. We tested different timelines on hundreds of new candidates from our advertising.   
 
AI crunched the data and showed that if we returned our candidates' first call. Text, application or resume within 15 minutes. We were six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. The team agreed that 15 minutes was a reasonable time to respond. So that became the new business rule.    
 
Section 2 Check & Balance:  

After that experience, I realized I needed a check and balance system. To ensure that my recruiters were treating each and every candidate the same. And the system informs the management team when business processes are not being followed. Or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure you do not miss a hiring deadline. To carry out this. We use check and balance rules in the workflow that could not be possible without automation with decision logic.    
 
Having check and balance rules in Hire up Funnels was an eye-opening experience for me. Before we put our check and balance in the workflow. We had no way to measure how our recruitment team followed up with canidates. Just like most of you.    
 
I did not know how long it took our recruiters to respond to new candidates from our advertising. Or if they were getting ghosted, It was like flying blind. With our check and balance rules. You will know if all your business’s best practices and recruitment rules are followed. Ensuring recruiter efficacy and good candidate experience. like flying with instruments, you know if you are on course or not, so you can correct and get back on track.    
 
Here is how the check and balance rules work. If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. Call a candidate back within 15 min of receiving a new candidate. The check and balance workflow would send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task and e-mail. Ensure a prompt callback and make sure the new candidate is not ghosted.    
 
Suppose this happens two times in a row. And the candidate is not called within the time limit of our business rules. In that case, the workflow sends a notification to the assigned recruitment manager. Who can then figure out why the new candidate. That you spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules. For the highest advertising-to-interview conversion ratio.    
 
Ensuring all candidates get a great experience. You are more productive; you hire more of the qualified candidates you are already talking to. The Hire Up funnels workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate. So, you hire more of the qualified canidates you are already talking to. Never worry if your team is not following best practices and rules. Our check and balance rules will keep you informed.   

After giving our team the information and tools to improve their results. Our team now has an average 5-minute response time to new candidates from our advertising. All recruiters have increased the number of hires. Some so much that you would not believe me if I shared them with you. Check and balance rules can carry out various tasks. We use several versions throughout our Hire Up Funnels.   
 
Section 3 Follow up programmed in check and balance rules.    
 
I wanted to beat the big company for the most placements badly. I dug a little deeper in the data and started to see a new pattern. I shared it with the team, and they confirmed it. When a candidate calls, text, or submit a resume. And if the call went to voicemail or a text was not returned, that started a domino effect of complications. The most time-consuming was the never-ending game of phone tag. To get the candidate back on the phone or respond to your text so you could activate. And start the recruitment process of qualification.    
 
I returned to my Hire up Funnels software and pulled reporting of follow-up attempts. To successful calls where we got the candidate on the phone to do the prescreening call to qualify. And move to the next stage of the recruitment cycle success path. 
 
The results were like the new candidate from advertising results. Every recruiter handled the new canidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason for how many follow-up calls a recruiter made. Everyone on the team had a different number of follow-up calls. We shared the results with the team. The high-performing recruiters made more follow-up calls than the low-performer ones. The report told us that 20% of the team gave up after only two follow-up attempts. That was disappointing...   
 
I shared the results with the team to see the best way to fix this. The recruiters that responded with the least number of follow-up calls. Shared some very valuable information with us. The main reason for not making as many follow-up calls. Was that they felt like they were pestering the candidates. And felt like they were being pushy. I can understand that.    
 
So, the big question was. How many times should candidates be called for the best contact, qualification, and hiring ratios? And so, your team knows the number of calls to make that they are not bothering candidates. So, we tested the candidates we had. To see the correct number of follow-ups. To get a candidate that responded to our job advertisement. On the phone who did not answer the recruiters' first return call.   
 
We tested calling, texting, and sending e-mails, and pixel targeting. It was surprising to learn that you must do much more follow-up than one would think for a job.  But you do not want to overdo it, burn out your candidates, and destroy your reputation in your market. The sweet spot is to be persistent but not a stalker. The stats told us that we needed to follow up seven. To eight times to get a candidate activated on the phone (without upsetting them). To do a prescreen call and qualify.    
 
Digging even deeper into the data. We also discovered that if we did not get the candidate on the phone in the first seven days after applying with us. They went cold and non-responsive. The tests we ran told us we got more people on the phone to prescreen. And qualify if we used a combination of phone calls and text messages, and e-mails.    
 
On a fluke my lead recruiter suggested that we try using our AI chatbot in our follow-up messages. To give our canidates the option to use the AI chatbot to book time to talk to the recruiter, and boy, did they.   
 
Section 4 Follow-up rules.    
 
We added follow-up rules to our check and balance workflow with that data. When the recruiter calls the new candidate back, the call is unanswered. We have a control requiring eight follow-ups for every new candidate not activated. The recruiter calls the candidate every other day for eight days. When the recruiter does not call. We set up the workflow to send our omnichannel communication.    
 
This way, we reach out to our candidate eight times in six days. With four calls from the recruiter and four automated Omni channel communication. Including AI chatbots, to schedule a call with a recruiter. Increasing the efficiency of our recruitment team. Getting more people on the phone. And into the qualification stage of the recruitment cycle.    
 
If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. The workflow would automatically send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task in their calendar and e-mail. If your recruiter does not adhere to the follow-up rules. Another reminder task is sent if this happens twice in a row. The candidate is not called within the time frame of our business rules. Then the workflow sends a notification. To the assigned recruitment manager. Who can figure out why the new candidate. That we spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules time frame.    
 
 
Ensure all candidates have a great recruitment experience. And we are more productive, so we hire more of the qualified candidates we are already talking to. The recruitment funnel workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate.  
 
Section 5 Conclusion 
 
Here is how important a good candidate's experience is. According to career plug. 80% of candidates said that a positive candidate experience influenced their decision to say yes to an offer. 58% of job seekers said that a poor candidate experience led them to decline a job.    
https://www.careerplug.com/blog/improve-hiring-with-better-communication/  
 
So, I adjusted my funnel with the check and balance rules of 15 min to return a call. And programed eight follow ups for every new candidate and relaunched it. Did some optimization and the team started to hire more people. We started to beat the big company for placements. With the same resources I was spending before I made the changes to the check and balance rules. It was an all-out war for the top spot. One week they would take the top spot, and the next week, we would take the top spot. This went on for several weeks, the competition was fierce. It was technology strategy versus strength, who would win?    
 
With a dedicated team and the right tools. We were able to track, measure and optimize our recruitment funnels. To become number one, we held the top spot to the end of the recruitment contract. Technology strategy wins over strength every time...    
 
Success is achieved by adjusting technology. To accommodate human behavior opened a whole new world for me. What else can I do to gain market advantage? So, I studied the biggest technology companies. To figure out how they grew so fast and became market leaders.   
 
Remember, there is something much bigger at play here than just data. As the data increases and the metrics become more trackable, It is easy to get sucked into the analytics of it all. And in the process, forget that there is a person on the other side of the metrics. A person with a problem, a person who needs you to solve their problem.

Over two decades ago, when I first entered the fascinating world of trucking and logistics recruitment, it was a different era. Hiring was a straightforward process back then, perhaps even rudimentary compared to today's standards. The industry was growing, and jobs were plentiful. Looking back, those were the days of simplicity in the hiring landscape.
But as the adage goes, ""Change is the only constant."" The tides of time swirled, and so did the logistics and trucking industry. The big problem was the driver shortage, a persistent thorn in the side of an industry otherwise buzzing with opportunity. It felt like being stranded on a highway with a truck full of promises but no drivers to steer it.
I struggled with this relentless challenge, tirelessly brainstorming strategies to attract and retain the drivers we hired. At times, it seemed like an impossible task. But I wasn't alone. The entire industry was facing the same predicament. We just started the AI revolution, and industries worldwide were turning to technology as their savior. Intrigued and inspired, I contemplated if AI could be our knight in shining armor.
The world event that revolutionized hiring was the adoption of Chat GPT. AI and automation in recruitment and retention processes. It happened slowly at first, but its impact was profound. Companies using AI and automation were beating out companies not using AI and automation. Companies started using AI-powered recruitment systems to automate recruitment workflows and automate communication through omnichannel. They even had ways to inform you how fast your recruitment team returned canidates calls and texts, ensuring the best canidates to application ratio. And no canidates get ghosted, providing a great candidate experience. So more of your qualified candidates make it to your job offer. Giving your team the canidates needed to make the best job-to-candidate match. 
From the shadows of this transformation emerged a glimmer of hope. Could we, too, harness the power of technology to tackle our recruitment woes? The promise was enticing, and the opportunity immense.
In this chapter, we'll traverse the hiring highway, shedding light on traditional hiring methods and exploring the role of technology in modern hiring processes. We'll delve into my personal journey and how my perspective on hiring has evolved. Drawing inspiration from the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" and the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" we'll learn to identify talent and overcome adversity. Buckle up, for an enlightening ride awaits us on the hiring highway.
Section 1 - Analysis of traditional hiring methods in the trucking industry
Steering back to the beginning of my career, hiring in the trucking industry was an art rooted in gut feelings, intuition, and personal judgment. Candidates were assessed primarily based on their ability to handle a truck, commitment to the job, and willingness to spend long hours on the road. They were face-to-face interactions, handshake deals, and decisions made around the coffee table. It was all incredibly human and intensely personal.
The process took time and often hit-or-miss. While we celebrated when we found the right fit, it was back to square one when we didn't. It was incredibly challenging to assess a candidate's commitment, adaptability, and resilience through just an interview or two. Our assessment was based largely on their past driving record and the charm of their personality.
Furthermore, the hiring process was localized. We predominantly relied on local talent pools or word-of-mouth referrals. Our go-to recruitment strategy was placing a help wanted ad in the local newspaper or at the town job fair to fill jobs. In some ways, it was comforting, familiar. But it was also limiting.
This traditional approach began showing its cracks as the industry grew more competitive. Trucking is about more than just driving from point A to point B. It's about adhering to tight schedules, maintaining the vehicle, managing on-road challenges, and ensuring the safe and timely delivery of goods while being a customer service rep. And most importantly, it's about doing all this consistently, day in and day out, while providing a great customer experience. 
These complexities were often overlooked in traditional hiring practices. As a result, we ended up hiring drivers who were good at driving but needed help with the other aspects of the job. The result? High turnover rates and a constant struggle to keep our complete fleet on the road.
As I navigated these challenges, I saw the need for a more robust, comprehensive hiring strategy that considered a candidate’s driving skills and overall suitability for the job. The seeds of change were sown. But what I needed was a game changer, a revolutionary approach that would take our hiring strategy from basic to brilliant.
Section 2 - The Role of Technology in modern hiring processes
The AI (artificial intelligence) Technology revolution began to assert its role in the modern hiring process during this quest for a new approach. Inspired by industries that were seamlessly integrating AI and automation in their hiring practices, I pondered upon its potential in ours.
As we dove deeper into the realm of technology, we discovered a world brimming with possibilities. Candidate Relation Management Systems (CRM) Built on advanced automation platforms. Equipped with AI capabilities were revolutionizing the way hiring was done. 
The sophisticated system had four different advanced automation systems running in the background. To provide your team with the right tools and system to streamline the recruitment processes. It promised recruiter efficiency, accuracy, and a significant reduction in time-to-hire by providing a great candidate experience. 
Moreover, data-driven hiring became a possibility. We could analyze historical data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. AI brought the power of predictive analytics, enabling us to foresee hiring trends, anticipate needs, and strategize accordingly. We could answer critical questions like: What traits do our best drivers share? What makes a driver stay with us for the long term?
Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual reality tools opened avenues for a more engaging candidate experience. Prospective drivers could interact with chatbots to get immediate answers to their queries. Virtual reality could give them a realistic simulation of their job, leading to better-informed decisions.
The role of technology in modern hiring processes extends beyond just finding and hiring the right candidate. It also played a significant part in onboarding and retaining the hired talent. Technology made keeping the drivers engaged and committed easier, from AI-assisted onboarding programs to regular check-ins and feedback loops.
Looking at all these possibilities, I was in awe of how technology could be a game changer. It had the potential to address the very issues we had been struggling with. It was a revolutionary, data-driven, and efficient approach to an age-old problem. As I stood on the brink of this technological revolution, I was convinced that this was the path we needed to tread.
Section 3 - My journey and the evolution of my perspective on hiring
In my journey from just a recruiter to being the top Digital Recruitment and Retention Strategies for the trucking and logistics industry.  I've weathered numerous storms and celebrated countless victories. Each phase offered a learning experience and substantially altered my perspective on hiring.
I started my career when hiring was primarily a personal affair. Hiring is based on a face-to-face interview and a person’s willingness to work hard. It was the age of intuition-based hiring. That's not to say it was flawed - I was a testament to its success. But as I moved up the ladder, I realized it was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.
I remember distinctly, a time in the early stages of my recruitment career when we were struggling with high turnover. We had a team of hard-working drivers, but they weren't staying. The strain of long hours, tight schedules, and road challenges was taking its toll. This was my first brush with the limitations of traditional hiring methods.
I realized then that hiring for the trucking industry needed more than just intuition - it required understanding the complexities of the job and assessing the candidate's capability to handle them. It was about hiring drivers who wouldn't just drive but thrive in the high-pressure, challenging trucking environment of today.
As I wrestled with these challenges, I discovered the potential of technology to transform our hiring process. What initially seemed like a daunting, almost alien concept started making sense. The more I delved into it, the more I saw its potential to streamline our hiring, expand our reach, and drastically improve our success rate.
My journey through the adoption of AI in hiring echoed the broader AI revolution that was transforming industries worldwide. It was a period of rapid evolution and change. Companies that embraced AI and advanced automation were propelling ahead, while those that resisted were falling behind.
In this whirlwind of change, I found inspiration in the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. They advocated a data-driven, structured approach to hiring - a methodology that could potentially revolutionize our hiring process. I also found motivation in the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". The protagonist's resilience, commitment, and relentless pursuit of his dream was a reflection of the kind of drivers we wanted to hire. I was able to harness the power of AI by following the lead from wall street quants. The dynamic world of Wall Street, known for its rapid fortunes made or lost, has seen the game completely changed with the introduction of AI and Quants. 
These influences shaped my perspective, leading me to understand that the key to successful hiring lay in a harmonious blend of technology and human touch. Humanity was becoming the new technology. I realized that while AI and automation could do much of the heavy lifting, the human element was critical in making the final call. After all, it was about finding people who would be the face of our company on the road. 
Section 4 - Learning from the reference book and movie, with a focus on identifying talent and overcoming adversity
I found valuable lessons in ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. The book gave me the tools to chart a course in the tumultuous seas of hiring, particularly as it focused on hiring for attitude and potential. They emphasized how it's not always about the qualifications or experience; it's about who they are as individuals and whether they align with the company's values and culture.
Their concept of the A player - an employee that has at least a 90 percent chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10 percent of possible candidates could achieve - resonated deeply. The A player for us was a driver who not only drove but also represented our company's values, was the face of our company, maintained strong customer relationships, and upheld the highest safety standards.
However, finding these A players required a change in our hiring approach. We needed to look beyond just the driving skills and delve deeper into their attitude, resilience, and potential. We needed a structured, data-driven approach that combined technology and human intuition - the perfect blend of artificial and emotional intelligence. 
This reminded me of how AI gave Wall Street Firms an edge over the competition. However, when AI became widely adopted, this advantage faded. This is where Quants, the heroes of wall street, stepped in. They brought forth a revolutionary approach, Hybrid AI. Where we use the best of human intelligence paired with artificial intelligence. The firms that adopted this approach by the Quants pulled ahead of the competition, redefining the leaders on wall street. 
Wall streets evolution parallels the current state of recruitment and retention. As quants disrupted Wall Street with Hybrid AI, recruitment and retention strategist are becoming the “quants” of HR. We are using Hybrid AI to improve recruitment and retention in the trucking and logistics industry. Where humans make the final decision aided by the data from AI. 
This is where the lessons from the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" came into play. The protagonist, Chris Gardner, was the embodiment of resilience and determination. He was a man with limited resources and opportunities, yet his unyielding determination to provide for his son and pursue his dream job was inspiring.
Gardner was a perfect example of an A player. He didn't have the qualifications or experience, but his attitude and resilience were unmatched. He was the kind of driver we wanted - one who would persist through challenges, remain committed to the job, and continuously strive for excellence.
The movie was a stark reminder that adversities can be overcome with a resilient spirit and a relentless pursuit of happiness. It was a reflection of the challenges our drivers faced - long hours, road hazards, solitude - and yet, with the right attitude and support, they could overcome them.
Bringing these lessons into our hiring process, we reshaped our strategy. We deployed AI tools to screen for skill-based parameters, freeing us to focus on personal traits during interviews. We looked for traits like resilience, determination, and a positive attitude, traits that we had overlooked in our traditional hiring approach.
We started conducting behavioral interviews, posing situational questions to assess how they would react in challenging scenarios. How did they handle a particularly challenging delivery? How did they cope with the solitude on long hauls? How did they deal with difficult customers or situations?
We began to see a change as we integrated these lessons into our hiring process. Our hiring decisions were becoming more informed, our driver pool was strengthening, and our retention rates were improving. We were making headway in our battle with the driver shortage.
Section 5 - Conclusion: Navigating the Road Ahead
The transformation in our recruitment approach was not an overnight occurrence; it was a journey paved with trials, errors, and learnings. However, these changes were essential and long overdue, not just for our company but for the trucking industry as a whole.
The lessons we learned, the improvements we made, and the progress we witnessed were encouraging. We managed to turn the wheels of our recruitment process, steering it away from traditional, limiting hiring practices towards a future defined by innovation, inclusivity, and intelligence. We succeeded in integrating the nuances of our industry, the essence of our drivers, and the power of technology into our hiring process.
Yet, as with any journey, ours is ongoing, and we continue to learn, adapt, and evolve. We are by no means perfect, and the driver shortage problem is far from resolved. But we are better than the competition, and that's what matters.
The AI revolution is reshaping recruitment and retention in the trucking industry, and its adoption is not a matter of” if” but “when.” The driver shortage is a pressing issue that warrants immediate attention and creative solutions. Advanced technology, AI, and automation present themselves as powerful allies in this fight. If you can connect the dots of strategy to use AI and advanced automation for you. 
The integration of technology in our hiring process has offered us insights, solutions, and opportunities we could not have imagined. It has allowed us to explore a wealth of untapped potential and resources that can prove to be game-changers in our industry.
However, technology is only a tool; its successful implementation and impact depend heavily on the user. A hammer in the hands of a child is merely a toy, but in the hands of a sculptor, it can create masterpieces. Similarly, AI and automation can transform the recruitment landscape in our industry, but only if used strategically and wisely.
And in this endeavor, empathy and understanding are our guiding lights. It's about remembering that behind every application and resume is a person with hopes, dreams, fears, and responsibilities. It's about knowing that a driver is not just a worker, but an ambassador of our company, a custodian of our goods, and a crucial link in our economic chain.
I implore other industry leaders, HR professionals, and transport managers to embrace this new dawn, challenge traditional norms, and navigate uncharted territories. The road ahead is uncertain, filled with challenges and opportunities alike. But if we navigate it together, sharing insights, learnings, and best practices, we can shape a future where driver shortages are a thing of the past, and the industry thrives with committed, competent, and content drivers.
Let this chapter serve as an invitation to embark on this transformative journey where technology meets talent acquisition. Remember, it's not about merely surviving the driver shortage but thriving through it.
Action Steps:
1.	Challenge the Norms: Question your existing recruitment practices. Are they effective? Are they limiting your pool of potential drivers?
2.	Adopt Technology: Embrace the use of AI and automation in your hiring process. Use them to streamline processes, broaden your search, and facilitate better decision-making.
3.	Focus on the Person, Not Just the Driver: Look beyond driving skills and qualifications. Assess attitudes, values, and potential. Remember, you're hiring a person, not just a driver.
4.	Learn and Adapt: Stay updated with industry trends, technological advancements, and best practices. Learn from others and be willing to adapt your processes accordingly.
5.	Share Your Insights: Don't keep your learnings to yourself. Share them with others in the industry. Remember, we're in this together.

Have you ever felt that life was happening for you instead of to you? Where, out of nowhere. You meet the love of your life or a business partner or are exposed to an ideal that changes your life. You did not do anything… life brought it to you. I was lucky enough to have that happen to me on September 14th, 1992. I was at 303 2nd Street, 5th floor in San Francisco, California.  
It was the first day of work at my dream job in advertising. Wanting to start strong, I started working on a list of businesses that did not advertise with us. Trying to drum up some new business. I scheduled an appointment with a company to meet at my office the next day. He showed up disheveled looking, wearing a stained shirt with old shoes. I thought, what did I get myself into?  We went to the conference room, and I got to know him and his business. It turns out he is one of San Francisco's biggest restauranteurs (never judge a book by its cover). He owned most of the restaurants in fisherman wharf, and the crab stands on the sidewalk. We spent most of the day together. When we were done, we put together some great advertising campaigns. 
He required a lot of extra work from me, like creating a process map of how the advertising would be handled. I had to set up tracking phone numbers. And document what ads had what unique phone number. So we can track which advertising campaign generated the lead. And he followed who would receive the lead and the outcome of the lead. So, he could do an ROI on his ad spend.    
 
The first year I did this for this client, I hated it. Setting up remote call forwarding tracking phone numbers sucked. It took forever on the phone with the phone company. I felt like I was doing a bunch of work the customer should be doing. But I was young and in my ignorance. I thought my job was to create great advertising campaigns to make the phone ring with leads. And it was the customer's job to turn the calls from the advertising into a sale.   

In my second year at the company, they changed the compensation plan. Overnight it changed the game. Advertising results have become more important than your sales results. Many top salespeople took it on the chine. Lots of their big sales from the previous year were cancelled.
The restauranteur customer I hated doing the extra work for. He was my biggest client this year. It was renewal time. I thought to myself. Watch it be my luck that the client gave me the numbers to keep my job last year. Cancels this year, and I got let fired because I could not make up the lost revenue.  So, I made him my first appointment; that way, I had time to try and recover if it went sideways and he canceled. I did not have access to the call reporting numbers or the call outcomes the customer did. So the first question I asked was, how do the numbers look? 
Section 2 

After a long pause, he got excited and shared with me the call report. And what he did with the call information. And how the calls were routed to reservations, and when a table was reserved, he used that for verification of sale. Then he shared the average ticket per table and how many times he turned tables throughout the day. He explained that if the servers sold high-profit items. Like desserts or bottled water to 10% of the tables, he would make another 20% return on his advertising.    
 
He whipped up all the data like his head chief that makes the cioppino his restaurants are famous for. And created what he called his sales machine. He was a six-sigma black belt and explained that his sales machine came from manufacturing. But instead of manufacturing and having an assembly line where you're creating widgets. You're manufacturing and have an assembly line where you are creating customers. I was hooked at first sight. It was the first time I had seen the sales process visually.    
 
Then he told me he was making $5.00 for every dollar he spent on advertising. Needless to say, he did not cancel his advertising. There was proof of the results; with that proof his sales machine, I could sell him the expanded advertising program I had set up. That sale pushed me over the top, and I earned one of the coveted top sales awards that year. And almost every year I worked there, all because of my customer’s sales machine.

When I entered the recruitment industry. I used the sales machine I learned from my advertising client. To build my first recruitment company. To over a million dollars in sales in the first six months in business. After a couple of years, I was able to buy my way out of corporate America and went to work at the recruitment company full-time.    
 
The first thing I did was go to work adjusting my sales machine. To accommodate the recruitment process. Instead of manufacturing and having an assembly line where you're creating customers. Like the sales machine. You're manufacturing and have an assembly line where you are creating successful employees. And reasons for them to say.    
 
I have gone through several different versions of the recruitment engine over the last two decades. I made adjustments dictated by the market conditions. And I also made improvements from what I learned working on my growth marketing certification from Digital Marketer. If you want to know about digital marketing. I highly recommend Ryan Deiss and the team at Digital Marketer.    
 
The recruitment engine is how I manufacture and produce qualified candidates. To be hired repeatably and predictively. It is a visual representation of how candidates are created. So, you can reduce the time it takes to fill a position. Streamline the application process. Improve the candidate's experience. So you lose fewer candidates as they go through the six stages of the recruitment cycle. Automate repetitive tasks for the recruiter efficiently. To free up time for more critical work. Like getting more of the qualified candidates your recruiter talks to, to your job offer. So, your team has a better chance of making the right job-to-candidate match. And you have a high-performing employee.

Section 3 Growth Marketing   

What I discovered when studying the success of the world's biggest technology companies that have become market leaders. They have attributed their success to one thing. Their skill at exploiting growth marketing, or they call it hacking growth, to produce network effects. That’s the one skill that enabled them to become market leaders.   
 
Growth marketers or growth hackers are the people who are responsible for all the functions that improve business revenue. This can include everything from acquiring new customers and turning them into repeat purchasers. And re-engaging the clients that drop out of the sales process. And bring them back to complete the sale, to find new ways to re-engage former clients to buy again. And ways to convert visitors who did not buy to new customers.  
 
Growth marketing or growth hacking's goal is. Not to achieve linear growth by increasing the workforce. Instead, growth is achieved by removing bottlenecks or friction in your technology. That produces small wins compounded over time. You are ultimately turning small improvements into landslide competitive advantages. And the more you continue to make small improvements. The more efficient and valuable your recruitment and retention technology becomes. It’s kind of like compounded interest in your retirement account. The longer you do it, the more it multiplies and increases in value.  
 
This is accomplished by marrying creativity with data analysis, marketing, and messaging. It works because your decisions stay rooted in data. At the same time, you still apply creativity. And curiosity while surveying your candidates. And your talent acquisition team at critical steps of the process.  They use a growth engine to guide the improvements.
 
Network effects occur when the value of your technology increases as its number of users grows. Network effects are among the most important reasons you pick one product or service over another. This growth engine technology strategy is moving from sales. And the marketing side of the business. To the recruitment and retention side of the business. I adapted this process to my recruitment and retention technology strategy.  I created a recruitment engine That turns small improvements in the candidate's experience. Into landslide recruitment advantages, creating network effects.
 

It works through a feedback loop. Whereby small wins compounded over time strengthen the recruitment and retention process. That produces market-shifting advantages. That are not easy for the competition to knock off. Which is precisely what we are looking for. The outcomes are that technology is strengthened as improvements are made. So more of your candidates make it to your job offer. 

Now just a small improvement in hires every month. Is a massive improvement after a year. Multiply that over the years you are in business, and the advantages are market shifting. The benefits you will have when you do this are not easy for the competition to knock off. Your recruitment engine creates an extra barrier to entry from competitors. Trying to poach your recruitment and retention strategy or, worse… your employees.  
 
The longer you improve, the more attractive your company's employer brand. And recruitment messaging becomes creating even more intrinsic value. Positioning you as the employer of choice. That drives even more candidates toward your job offer. And that only continues your landslide advantage in the talent market.  

The world event that guided our path was the use of growth marketing. According to LinkedIn, Growth is so important right now. The growth marketing manager role is the No. 1 fastest-growing job in Canada and France. In the United States, head of revenue operations (definitely a growth role) tops the list. And three countries — India, Mexico, and the United Kingdom — listed the head of growth or chief growth officer among its top 10, at the time of the writing of this book.  
 
As you can see, this growth engine strategy is being adopted in all types of businesses worldwide. It requires a skill set that most people just don’t have. Companies that are not using this growth engine strategy. Are scrambling to hire people who can execute it to grow their company. Why? Because it works.   
 
This is the human strategy side of our Hybrid AI. That is reshaping recruitment and retention. So if you only execute an AI strategy. Without the human strategy of growth marketing, you will never experience the network effect. HR departments are following the lead of enterprise-sized companies. In adapting this strategy with their technology. We are entering a time when we can no longer set up a recruitment technology strategy and forget it again. It is complex, and then you add AI to the mix, which adds a whole new level of complexity; I understand I have been in your shoes. I will make it as simple for you as I can.   

Section 4 Introduce the recruitment engine. 
I bet you have never heard of a recruitment engine. Or know what a recruitment engine is? 

The creation of a recruitment engine. A recruitment engine is my customer's sales machine strategy. And the growth engine strategy from growth marketing. I combined those strategies and created a recruitment engine. It is the documented stages of the candidate's recruitment journey to your job offer. To create a funnel map of all conversion points to the job offer. 
 
We document the digital journey to identify friction and bottlenecks. If removed will give a better recruitment experience to your candidates. So fewer of them fall out as they move through the six stages of the recruitment cycle, and more qualified candidates will make it to your job offer. Getting you more hires and the most significant return for your time, effort, and investment. A recruitment engine is also the visual representation of your candidates' journey to your job offer. It starts when a candidate responds to an open job. And ends when the job offer is accepted or denied. Your company's recruitment cycle.    
 
Your recruitment engine also serves the purpose of the visual representation we will give the higher-ups to get the project approval. We will use our recruitment engine as evidence to support our claim. To show the benefits of doing the project. And the recruitment engine will also show you the consequences. Of not solving your recruitment and retention problem. It will highlight the parts of the recruitment process that are going well. And the areas that could be going better. To highlight bottlenecks and friction causing you to lose qualified candidates.  
 
To create your recruitment engine, we document your candidate's journey to your job offer. The six different stages in the candidate's experience. We do that with a tool I created, the recruitment cycle success path. The recruitment cycle success path is a series of stages that guide candidates. Through the recruitment experience with your company, from application to job offer. The stages in the candidate's experience make up your company’s recruitment engine.  
 
You break down each stage of the recruitment lifecycle into two experiences. The technology experience and the messaging experience. They have different objectives. But overlap and must be congruent to produce high-performing employees. So, let's go ahead and map the bottlenecks. And friction in the candidate’s technology experience. I will be going into some explanation of the messaging strategy to give context. To how all of the moving parts work together. My book, Reshaping Recruitment, Transformation of Employer Branding with AI and Advanced Automation, covers my complete messaging strategy. Based on Maslow’s needs theory, so our messaging talks to our candidates, not at them.  
________________________________________
Section 5 Recruitment Cycle Success Path.  
The recruitment cycle comprises four main milestones. Your candidate goes through on their journey to employment with your company. These milestones are: Welcome, Activate, Diagnose & Qualify, Prescribe & Job Offer, then after they are hired, they stop the recruitment life cycle and enter a new phase with the company. The employee life cycle. The process is simple. Straightforward and easy to understand for your candidates and the talent acquisition team.   
 
 
Section 1: Welcome    
 
Your new candidates enter the Welcome Stage. After they have been exposed to your job advertising or were sourced by your team. And are interested in learning more about the position. So they call, submit a resume or fill out an online application and become traffic you own. The candidates that your recruitment team did not talk to are moved to the activation stage.   
 
Section 2: Activate   
 
Most new canidates will land in the Activate stage. Because applicants would rather fill out a mini application or submit a resume than a call about the job. That causes the first bottleneck to get that canidates to your job offer. When a new candidate fills out an application or online form, your canidates automatically go into the activation stage. Because Your team must go through the extra work of following up to get your canidates on the phone to qualify. 

This is where most businesses stop and miss out on a great chance to build a relationship. This stage can also be a nurturing phase of the recruitment cycle to establish trust. And delivers value to build relationships with your candidates. Candidates can be moved into the activation stage. At different points in the recruitment cycle, they fall out.
 
Section 3: Diagnose & Qualify   
 
In this stage of the recruitment cycle. You start the prescreening with questions intended to determine if the candidate is qualified for the position. These questions are designed to diagnose not only a person's ability and skills. But also their career goals and ensure they align with company values. If the candidate is qualified, they move to the Prescribe & Job Offer Section. If not qualified, depending on the reason. They can go onto an alternative path to employment, or we choose not to recruit.   

Section 4: Prescribe & Job Offer    
 
In this stage, the outcome depends on the results of the interview. If you decide they are qualified. You want to make a job offer to get them on-boarded and start on their career path with your company. If they are not qualified now. You can prescribe an alternative path to employment if qualified.   
 
This is where the recruitment cycle ends. And the employee lifecycle starts. 

Section 5: Conclusion
In this journey, we have navigated the challenges of the trucking and logistics industry, understood the potential of AI in recruitment, and shared the transformative experience of a recruitment engine. We've learned from influential books and big tech and seen how AI can give businesses a competitive edge that's more crucial than ever in today's cutthroat market.
The decision to embrace AI in recruitment is no longer optional; it's a necessity. Faced with an acute driver shortage, companies must rethink their recruitment strategies. Hybrid AI offers not just an efficient recruitment process but a strategic tool. A recruitment engine that improves the quality of hire, enhances retention and ultimately impacts a company’s reputation and growth.
The book ""Hacking Growth "" and the network effect further underscore this truth. They illuminate the transformative power of Hybrid AI and the perils of clinging to outdated methods. The message is clear: There's no room for speculation or stagnation in the relentless pursuit of a competitive edge.
AI doesn't sleep; it constantly learns, adapts, and improves, working tirelessly to give your company the competitive edge it needs to succeed. It's time to step into the future of recruitment to use data-driven methods to attract and retain the best talent.
There’s an AI revolution unfolding, reshaping recruitment and retention. The choice is yours: to be part of the revolution and thrive, or ignore it and risk becoming irrelevant.
Action Steps:
1.	Research: Explore various AI-powered recruitment tools available in the market. Look for features relevant to your business, like data processing capacity, and industry-specific solutions.
2.	Evaluate: Consider your current recruitment process. Identify areas where AI could bring efficiency, reduce speculation, and enhance results.
3.	Invest: Commit to adopting an AI-powered recruiter and use your recruitment engine to make your recruitment more efficient. It's not just a purchase but an investment in your company's future.
4.	Review and refine: Regularly review your recruitment process and software. Look for areas of improvement and optimize their usage for better results creating the network effect.
In conclusion, the driver shortage in the trucking and logistics industry is a complex issue but not an insurmountable one. With the AI-powered recruiter, hybrid AI and a recruitment engine, you can redefine recruitment, solve talent acquisition challenges, and gain the competitive edge you need to thrive.

Launch a powerful brand with a best-selling book. Don't let feeling unseen or lacking knowledge hold you back - your success story starts here. #Inspiration #SuccessJourney,Chapter 1: Unleashing Your Power: R.E.S.O.U.R.C.E.S for Unstoppable Success,"Hey Y’all! This is AI Zachariah and I present to you the One Book Millionaire. 

With this book, you're about to embark on a journey that will catapult you from an unknown quantity to a brand rockstar, transforming you into a recognizable figure who is valued based on your purpose and impact.

So what is the One Book Millionaire? It is an iterative process that uses the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to turn everyday authors into everyday millionaires.

We all know that some people like to skip dessert first, so let me give you the dessert first. How you get to become a millionaire is by starting to write a book. 

Most of you might be thinking how do you even write a book? You might be wondering or perhaps you are unsure how to even begin writing your very own bestselling book. But do not worry—we've got you covered. We've got your back with the 96 Hour Book Challenge. 

What you need to do is to take the 96 Hour Book Challenge, and you'll be on your way.

WE USE AI!!!!!


Although I just want you to remember, technology, especially AI, should never be a shortcut—it should be an enhancer. 

You wouldn't want a steak cooked in the microwave for three minutes, would you? So, let's slow-cook your success on the grill, infusing it with the steak butter, rosemary and thyme we need for all the flavors of your raw resources.

Remember, ALWAYS START with the end in mind. 

So who is this book for?

If you're a speaker, coach, author, or thought leader feeling underappreciated and unseen in the market, this book is for you.

Most people don't have the success that they want. That is because they are not fit, they are not millionaire fit. Just like how you get fit in the gym, you can also become a millionaire fit…

Writing a book and making a million dollars might sound tough, but it's as easy as flipping a 500 pound tire… when you've got the right resources and mindset. It's time to flip the tire, make that financial win, and turn yourself into a brand rockstar.

I'm a big fitness guy. I believe that the discipline and motivation it takes to be successful in the gym is what can launch you to success in becoming a One Book Millionaire.. It's all about using your inherent raw resources to achieve maximum results.

Your raw resources are your experiences, expertise, and personality. Throughout this journey, you'll learn the importance of  using your raw resources in achieving success. 

Notice that I didn't say, what's in your bank account, what certification you have or a PhD, the history of your family, what house you're in, or what car you drive… NONE OF THAT SHIT MATTERS. You only need to harness the power of your raw resources.

I can share with you that I've sold $20,000 programs with just a Google doc and a Stripe link, all because I knew one thing: how to harness my raw resources.

What do I mean by being R.A.W.? 

Real Transparency
Authenticity
Willingness to be vulnerable

Be authentic and transparent. That's the key.

Get RAW. 

So what are your R.E.S.O.U.R.C.E.S?

Relatable Stories
Experience
Skillset
Open Communication
Unwavering Commitment
Resourcefulness
Collaboration
Empathy
Strategic Planning

Harness your power using your R.E.S.O.U.R.C.E.S.

This book will show you how to stop underestimating the value of these resources and leverage them to create a powerful, authentic, and transparent narrative.

Are you ready to stop wasting time?

Are you ready to live the life of your dreams?

Are you ready to finally become the coach you know you are always meant to be and make the kind of money that you know you're always meant to make?

It's time to become millionaire-fit by completing the One Book Millionaire training.

We all know that some people like to skip dessert first, so let me give you the dessert first. How you get to become a millionaire is by starting to write a book. 

Most of you might be thinking how do you even write a book? You might be wondering or perhaps you are unsure how to even begin writing your very own bestselling book. But do not worry—we've got you covered. We've got your back with the 96 Hour Book Challenge. 

What you need to do is to take the 96 Hour Book Challenge, and you'll be on your way.

Although I just want you to remember, technology, especially AI, should never be a shortcut—it should be an enhancer. 

You wouldn't want a steak cooked in the microwave for three minutes, would you? So, let's slow-cook your success on the grill, infusing it with the steak butter, rosemary and thyme we need for all the flavors of your raw resources.

Remember, ALWAYS START with the end in mind. 

So who is this book for?

If you're a speaker, coach, author, or thought leader feeling underappreciated and unseen in the market, this book is for you.

Most people don't have the success that they want. That is because they are not fit, they are not millionaire fit. Just like how you get fit in the gym, you can also become a millionaire fit…

Writing a book and making a million dollars might sound tough, but it's as easy as flipping a 500 pound tire… when you've got the right resources and mindset. It's time to flip the tire, make that financial win, and turn yourself into a brand rockstar.

I'm a big fitness guy. I believe that the discipline and motivation it takes to be successful in the gym is what can launch you to success in becoming a One Book Millionaire.. It's all about using your inherent raw resources to achieve maximum results.

Your raw resources are your experiences, expertise, and personality. Throughout this journey, you'll learn the importance of  using your raw resources in achieving success. 

Notice that I didn't say, what's in your bank account, what certification you have or a PhD, the history of your family, what house you're in, or what car you drive… NONE OF THAT SHIT MATTERS. You only need to harness the power of your raw resources.

I can share with you that I've sold $20,000 programs with just a Google doc and a Stripe link, all because I knew one thing: how to harness my raw resources.

What do I mean by being R.A.W.? 

Real Transparency
Authenticity
Willingness to be vulnerable

Be authentic and transparent. That's the key.

Get RAW. 

So what are your R.E.S.O.U.R.C.E.S?

Relatable Stories
Experience
Skillset
Open Communication
Unwavering Commitment
Resourcefulness
Collaboration
Empathy
Strategic Planning

Harness your power using your R.E.S.O.U.R.C.E.S.

This book will show you how to stop underestimating the value of these resources and leverage them to create a powerful, authentic, and transparent narrative.

Are you ready to stop wasting time?

Are you ready to live the life of your dreams?

Are you ready to finally become the coach you know you are always meant to be and make the kind of money that you know you're always meant to make?

Discover how to leverage cutting-edge technology and innovative strategies to stay ahead of the competition. Don't miss out on the opportunity to revolutionize your recruiting game!,Chapter 3 Speed is what matters.,"I remember like it yesterday. I had landed a giant recruitment contract. But I did not know I was not the only recruitment company with the contract. They also contracted with one of my biggest competitors. 
The big company had more people and more resources, and they were using them to beat me out for all the placements. I was in the fight of my business life. They did not like me being there and were determined to push me out. I needed to make placements, or I would lose the contract, and the big company would win. 

So I decided I would use the shotgun approach. I upped my advertising budget again and did a text message campaign for the candidates that were on my list (candidates I own). It kind of worked, and kind of didn’t work... here is what I mean. The number of candidates that responded to our job posting & text message campaign increased.   

But the number of people we hired only increased for some recruiters and not others. The strange thing I noticed about the results is. I would have 2 recruiters with the same skill set and get two wildly different results from them. You would think the results would be similar to each other. It was frustrating...I suspected that something was up. If I could solve this puzzle, I could easily double my profits with the same number of resources, ad spend, and effort I am using now.  

I started searching for any study, report, or any bit of creditable information on what would cause such a difference in performance with two equally skilled recruiters. I read article after article clicking link after link in the articles for what seemed like weeks until I finally ended up finding a study by Harvard business review. I found a study on sales companies' response rates 
 

Our research shows that most companies are not responding nearly fast enough… our research indicates that many firms are too slow to follow up on these leads. We audited 2,241 U.S. companies…. 24% took more than 24 hours—and 23% of the companies never responded at all. The average response time…. was 42 hours.  
These results are especially shocking given how quickly online leads go cold. Firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times as likely to qualify the lead….as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later—and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer.”’ 
Source: Harvard Business Review 
https://timetoreply.com/harvard-business-review/ 
 
The first time I read the report, I thought it had valuable information. And I put the report in my file to read again. I continued my search, but I could not find anything that useful. A few weeks passed, and I picked up the Harvard business review report to read it again. When I finished reading the report, I came to a different conclusion. Have you ever experienced that? You get a different message from the same report or book on a different read. 

This time reading the report, I realized the variable for success was not the sales skill of the salesperson. The variable for success was the speed at which the salesperson responded to the lead. Only after the salesperson was talking to a prospect did the sales skill come into play. 

I wondered if that was happening with my recruitment team. It would explain the discrepancy between the two recruiters with similar skills. With these market conditions, candidates rule the hiring process. Who knows. First, I needed to know how fast we respond to new candidates. To do that, we had to pull reporting from our phone system. And reporting from our hire-up funnel software and cross reference that will the call report to get the full picture. We broke it down by each recruiter extension and transfer.  

Here is what we uncovered each recruiter handled their new candidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason on how my recruiters responded to the new canidates they received from our advertising.  As we studied the data, a pattern started to emerge. We cross-referenced that with the placements report, and my suspicions were confirmed.  

Some of our recruiters responded to new canidates on the day they applied and they filled a lot more jobs than the recruiters that responded the following day or the following two days. There was a direct correlation between how fast a call, text, or resume was responded to by a recruiter. And the total number of people hired by that recruiter. 

The Harvard Business Review Report proved to ring true in recruiting candidates from the Internet. This means we lost a lot of candidates, which cost a lot of money. And wasted a lot of our recruiter's time following up trying to get these canidates on the phone to qualify. All because we delayed responding to new canidates one day. Is your team doing the same thing?  

Section 1 Ghosting Canidates 

That reminded me of a project we did for a client. They were having all kinds of issues with their hiring. So we did a survey of all the candidates they did not hire, and the results were eye-opening 30% of the candidates said that the recruiter ghosted them. Almost half of the ghosted candidates said it happened more than two times.    
 
This damaged their employer's brand. And can have a negative effect on future candidates from applying. It is critical that candidate ghosting does not happen. And adequate and appropriate feedback given to job seekers. No matter what stage of the hiring process they are in.    
 
Reshaping recruitment and retention is all about human interaction. It is not just about AI or an online experience; it has a human element. So, you must integrate human interaction with technology and AI to achieve the greatest results, hybrid AI. I worked with the team to determine the best way to respond to new candidates from our advertising. After weeks of trial and error. We tested different timelines on hundreds of new candidates from our advertising.   
 
AI crunched the data and showed that if we returned our candidates' first call. Text, application or resume within 15 minutes. We were six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. The team agreed that 15 minutes was a reasonable time to respond. So that became the new business rule.    
 
Section 2 Check & Balance:  

After that experience, I realized I needed a check and balance system. To ensure that my recruiters were treating each and every candidate the same. And the system informs the management team when business processes are not being followed. Or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure you do not miss a hiring deadline. To carry out this. We use check and balance rules in the workflow that could not be possible without automation with decision logic.    
 
Having check and balance rules in Hire up Funnels was an eye-opening experience for me. Before we put our check and balance in the workflow. We had no way to measure how our recruitment team followed up with canidates. Just like most of you.    
 
I did not know how long it took our recruiters to respond to new candidates from our advertising. Or if they were getting ghosted, It was like flying blind. With our check and balance rules. You will know if all your business’s best practices and recruitment rules are followed. Ensuring recruiter efficacy and good candidate experience. like flying with instruments, you know if you are on course or not, so you can correct and get back on track.    
 
Here is how the check and balance rules work. If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. Call a candidate back within 15 min of receiving a new candidate. The check and balance workflow would send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task and e-mail. Ensure a prompt callback and make sure the new candidate is not ghosted.    
 
Suppose this happens two times in a row. And the candidate is not called within the time limit of our business rules. In that case, the workflow sends a notification to the assigned recruitment manager. Who can then figure out why the new candidate. That you spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules. For the highest advertising-to-interview conversion ratio.    
 
Ensuring all candidates get a great experience. You are more productive; you hire more of the qualified candidates you are already talking to. The Hire Up funnels workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate. So, you hire more of the qualified canidates you are already talking to. Never worry if your team is not following best practices and rules. Our check and balance rules will keep you informed.   

After giving our team the information and tools to improve their results. Our team now has an average 5-minute response time to new candidates from our advertising. All recruiters have increased the number of hires. Some so much that you would not believe me if I shared them with you. Check and balance rules can carry out various tasks. We use several versions throughout our Hire Up Funnels.   
 
Section 3 Follow up programmed in check and balance rules.    
 
I wanted to beat the big company for the most placements badly. I dug a little deeper in the data and started to see a new pattern. I shared it with the team, and they confirmed it. When a candidate calls, text, or submit a resume. And if the call went to voicemail or a text was not returned, that started a domino effect of complications. The most time-consuming was the never-ending game of phone tag. To get the candidate back on the phone or respond to your text so you could activate. And start the recruitment process of qualification.    
 
I returned to my Hire up Funnels software and pulled reporting of follow-up attempts. To successful calls where we got the candidate on the phone to do the prescreening call to qualify. And move to the next stage of the recruitment cycle success path. 
 
The results were like the new candidate from advertising results. Every recruiter handled the new canidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason for how many follow-up calls a recruiter made. Everyone on the team had a different number of follow-up calls. We shared the results with the team. The high-performing recruiters made more follow-up calls than the low-performer ones. The report told us that 20% of the team gave up after only two follow-up attempts. That was disappointing...   
 
I shared the results with the team to see the best way to fix this. The recruiters that responded with the least number of follow-up calls. Shared some very valuable information with us. The main reason for not making as many follow-up calls. Was that they felt like they were pestering the candidates. And felt like they were being pushy. I can understand that.    
 
So, the big question was. How many times should candidates be called for the best contact, qualification, and hiring ratios? And so, your team knows the number of calls to make that they are not bothering candidates. So, we tested the candidates we had. To see the correct number of follow-ups. To get a candidate that responded to our job advertisement. On the phone who did not answer the recruiters' first return call.   
 
We tested calling, texting, and sending e-mails, and pixel targeting. It was surprising to learn that you must do much more follow-up than one would think for a job.  But you do not want to overdo it, burn out your candidates, and destroy your reputation in your market. The sweet spot is to be persistent but not a stalker. The stats told us that we needed to follow up seven. To eight times to get a candidate activated on the phone (without upsetting them). To do a prescreen call and qualify.    
 
Digging even deeper into the data. We also discovered that if we did not get the candidate on the phone in the first seven days after applying with us. They went cold and non-responsive. The tests we ran told us we got more people on the phone to prescreen. And qualify if we used a combination of phone calls and text messages, and e-mails.    
 
On a fluke my lead recruiter suggested that we try using our AI chatbot in our follow-up messages. To give our canidates the option to use the AI chatbot to book time to talk to the recruiter, and boy, did they.   
 
Section 4 Follow-up rules.    
 
We added follow-up rules to our check and balance workflow with that data. When the recruiter calls the new candidate back, the call is unanswered. We have a control requiring eight follow-ups for every new candidate not activated. The recruiter calls the candidate every other day for eight days. When the recruiter does not call. We set up the workflow to send our omnichannel communication.    
 
This way, we reach out to our candidate eight times in six days. With four calls from the recruiter and four automated Omni channel communication. Including AI chatbots, to schedule a call with a recruiter. Increasing the efficiency of our recruitment team. Getting more people on the phone. And into the qualification stage of the recruitment cycle.    
 
If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. The workflow would automatically send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task in their calendar and e-mail. If your recruiter does not adhere to the follow-up rules. Another reminder task is sent if this happens twice in a row. The candidate is not called within the time frame of our business rules. Then the workflow sends a notification. To the assigned recruitment manager. Who can figure out why the new candidate. That we spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules time frame.    
 
 
Ensure all candidates have a great recruitment experience. And we are more productive, so we hire more of the qualified candidates we are already talking to. The recruitment funnel workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate.  
 
Section 5 Conclusion 
 
Here is how important a good candidate's experience is. According to career plug. 80% of candidates said that a positive candidate experience influenced their decision to say yes to an offer. 58% of job seekers said that a poor candidate experience led them to decline a job.    
https://www.careerplug.com/blog/improve-hiring-with-better-communication/  
 
So, I adjusted my funnel with the check and balance rules of 15 min to return a call. And programed eight follow ups for every new candidate and relaunched it. Did some optimization and the team started to hire more people. We started to beat the big company for placements. With the same resources I was spending before I made the changes to the check and balance rules. It was an all-out war for the top spot. One week they would take the top spot, and the next week, we would take the top spot. This went on for several weeks, the competition was fierce. It was technology strategy versus strength, who would win?    
 
With a dedicated team and the right tools. We were able to track, measure and optimize our recruitment funnels. To become number one, we held the top spot to the end of the recruitment contract. Technology strategy wins over strength every time...    
 
Success is achieved by adjusting technology. To accommodate human behavior opened a whole new world for me. What else can I do to gain market advantage? So, I studied the biggest technology companies. To figure out how they grew so fast and became market leaders.   
 
Remember, there is something much bigger at play here than just data. As the data increases and the metrics become more trackable, It is easy to get sucked into the analytics of it all. And in the process, forget that there is a person on the other side of the metrics. A person with a problem, a person who needs you to solve their problem.

Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.

Join the conversation and share your thoughts. #AIinRecruitment #FairHiring,Introduction,"Picture this: A time in the not-so-distant future where job applications are screened, shortlisted, interviewed, and hired, not by human beings, but by artificial intelligence. Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

It's time to embrace innovation and think outside the box to attract and retain top talent. 🚀 #Innovation #TopTalent #GameChangers,Introduction,"Picture this: A time in the not-so-distant future where job applications are screened, shortlisted, interviewed, and hired, not by human beings, but by artificial intelligence. Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

The problem wasn't just about finding people with the appropriate driving skills and experience; it was about finding individuals who could also endure long hours on the road, maintain safety standards, and stay committed to the job despite the inherent challenges. The gravity of the issue hit me harder when we began losing contracts due to our inability to ensure timely deliveries.
We employed consultants who told us the problem was we were not getting enough applicants, so we went with an advertising agency, and we were receiving more applications, but the returns were far from satisfactory. Then the consultant told us our problem was that we were not converting the applicants into employees. So we should raise our wages. We were fighting an uphill battle, and I realized the necessity of a transformational shift in our approach.
This chapter is a deep dive into that revelation, the revolution of recruitment with AI and automation. I invite you to join me on this journey as I recount my experiences, the lessons learned, and the transformation that ensued. I believe this could be the pivotal turn you've been seeking in your recruitment strategy.

Ever since the advent of Industry 4.0 in 2011 with advanced automation, the world has witnessed an increasing usage of AI and automation across industries. AI has seeped into various business processes, from manufacturing to healthcare, retail to logistics, enhancing efficiency, productivity, and decision-making. As the world adapts to this new era of brilliant technologies, it's time for us, the trucking and logistics industry leaders, to take the leap and harness the power of AI for our recruitment and retention needs.
The road ahead may seem daunting, but as we embark on this transformative journey together, the opportunities for growth and prosperity are limitless.

Section 1: Introduction to AI-Powered Recruiter and Its Potential
Artificial Intelligence (AI), for the uninitiated, may seem like a concept straight out of a science fiction novel. But in reality, it is a technology that has been influencing our lives in ways we often fail to recognize - from online shopping recommendations to email spam filters, from voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to social media feeds. In the business world, AI has been a catalyst for significant advancements, with recruitment being one of the prime beneficiaries. 
Let me introduce you to the AI-Powered Recruiter. AI-powered recruitment essentially applies machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics in hiring processes. By harnessing the power of AI, companies can streamline their recruitment efforts, making them more efficient and effective. But why is AI so relevant in recruitment, particularly in an industry as traditional as trucking and logistics? Let's explore.
In the logistics industry, a profession like truck driving demands specific qualifications, skills, and mental and physical fortitude. Traditional recruitment methods, while necessary, are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. A job posting used to generate 20 to 30 applications. Nowadays, you would be Lucky to get 10 (qualified), out of which only a handful might be viable candidates if you are lucky. Getting these new canidates to talk to a recruiter is harder than you would think. Nowadays, most canidates, especially millennials and Gen Z, apply by filling out a mini application or submitting a resume. This makes qualifying these new applicants time-consuming, and following up to schedule initial interviews require significant human resources and time.
Enter AI. An AI-powered recruiter. A complete hiring system that automates these repetitive, time-consuming tasks, and gets canidates to contact your recruiters.  Freeing up the recruiters' time for more strategic activities. Imagine an intelligent system that can re-engage the qualified canidates that dropped out of your recruitment cycle. And deliver more qualified canidates to your job offer and even schedule interviews with the most suitable applicants. Not only does it accelerate the recruitment process, but it also reduces the likelihood of missing out on a promising candidate.
Moreover, AI can drastically improve the quality of hire. Advanced algorithms can analyze vast data points, including a candidate's experience, skills, qualifications, and even soft factors like cultural fit and personality traits. This data-driven approach ensures that the candidates shortlisted for the interview stage are not just qualified but are also likely to succeed and stay with the company for a longer period.
The most exciting advantage of AI is its predictive capabilities. With machine learning algorithms, AI can analyze historical hiring data and predict future hiring outcomes. For example, it can predict which candidates are more likely to accept a job offer, which recruits are likely to stay longer, or which potential hires may become A Players. Such insights can be incredibly valuable in strategic decision-making and planning.
However, the introduction of AI in recruitment is not just about addressing the current challenges. It’s about gearing up for the future. In a world where digital literacy and tech-savviness are becoming as crucial as traditional skills, adopting AI can enhance an organization’s employer brand image, making it more attractive to the younger, tech-savvy generation of workers.
Indeed, AI-powered recruiter holds enormous potential for the trucking and logistics industry. It promises a future where the best talent can be identified, recruited, and retained efficiently and effectively. Yet, as with any technology, understanding its working mechanism is crucial for successful implementation. The following section will dissect how AI and automation operate in recruitment.
Section 2: Breakdown of How AI and Automation Work in the Recruitment Process
At first glance, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation in recruitment may seem like a complex web of algorithms and data points. However, when broken down, it reveals itself as a seamless integration of intelligent processes and systems designed to enhance efficiency and precision in hiring. To truly appreciate AI’s revolution in recruitment, let us delve into its operational mechanics.
The heart of the AI-powered recruiter hiring system is the three-part framework for reshaping recruitment & retention in the digital transformation of hiring. So, you can hire high-performing employees. Even if you are not the highest paying job or offer a sign-on bonus no matter the market conditions. Helping you beat out bigger companies with more resources and bigger recruitment teams.   
The system's first part is Hire up Funnels, our primary technology. We use several different types of technologies to perform specific tasks. In our recruitment and retention software strategy. Hire Up funnels is designed to automate repetitive tasks and make it faster and easier to engage candidates so more make it to your job offer. 

To do this, we have three actions running at the same time in the background. The first action is workflow process automation. To ensure efficiency in processing new canidates. The second action is communication automation through mutable communication channels. To ensure every candidate gets the same great experience to increase engagement. The third action is check and balance rules. To ensure that your canidates are followed up according to your business best practices. And come with the strategy already programmed for you; no tech skills are required. The reason funnels are great is that they are predictable and automated.
 
The heart of AI-powered recruiter lies in its ability to parse vast amounts of data quickly and accurately. This involves two crucial components: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). 
NLP is an AI tool that allows computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a meaningful way. In the recruitment context, NLP can analyze resumes, job descriptions, emails, and even social media activity, extracting relevant information about the candidate's qualifications, experience, skills, and more. 
We can now harness the power of the world’s best copywriters… with Chat GPT. This one part of AI has completely changed my business. Before Chat GPT if you want to hire me as your recruitment strategist to build out your recruitment online strategy. I also came up with a team of top people to execute the strategy. The cost made the service out of budget for most companies. Now that I use AI, I have reduced the cost of my services by 80% and provided a better service. Allowing me to offer my services to a wider audience now. 
The second part of the AI-Powered Recruiter hiring system is My four-part framework for creating messaging that appeals to the ""human nature"" in all us. Based on Abraham Maslow's phycological theory of human needs. So, your employer brand and career messing talks ""to"" your candidates. Not ""at"" your candidates. So you have a message that impacts job seekers.   
Meanwhile, Machine Learning algorithms learn from historical data to make predictions about future outcomes. For instance, by analyzing the data of past successful hires, an ML tool can identify patterns or common factors and use them to rank potential candidates. Thus, not only can ML tools help screen and shortlist candidates, but they can also predict their potential for success in the role.
Another significant aspect of AI-powered recruiter is automation. Automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks that would typically require human intervention. In recruitment, automation can significantly streamline the process by taking over repetitive, time-consuming tasks.
For example, consider the task of scheduling interviews. Coordinating schedules between recruiters and candidates can be a tedious back-and-forth process. Automation with decision logic can handle this task efficiently, syncing with all parties’ calendars, proposing suitable time slots, and sending reminders when the interview date approaches.
Overall, automation with decision logic provides greater control. Customization and efficiency compared to automation without decision logic. Automation with decision logic provides more flexibility and control over the automation process. Decision logic allows for introducing conditions, and branching. And other more advanced options for the automation process can help fine-tune the automation's behavior to match the desired outcomes better. This can lead to more personalized experiences for candidates. improved efficiency for your recruitment team, and better results. In contrast, automation is without decision logic. It is limited to simple, linear processes that do not allow much customization or variability.
Then there's the automation of candidate communication. One of the ways to dramatically increase your recruiter’s productivity is to automate their communication. We use eight main recruitment funnels to automate our omnichannel communication. Call, Text, email, and pixel targeting. All the messaging funnels are designed to engage your candidates.  
AI-powered chatbots can interact with candidates, answering their queries, providing them with job information, and even gathering basic details for preliminary screening.
But perhaps the most remarkable use of automation in recruitment lies in the area of check and balance rules. The problem with recruitment software is that management has no idea how their team is using it. AI-Powered Recruiter’s strategic design also provides management of real-time data if canidates are not handled according to business rules. To maximize the application-to-job offer ratio for the best job-to-candidate match.  
One of the biggest mistakes recruiters make is, not following up with new canidates fast enough. It is important to get back to new canidates right away. Data shows that if you return your candidates' first call, text, application, or resume within 15 minutes, you are six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. This means that if you wait longer than 15 minutes to get back to a new candidate, you have already lost them. The variable for success is the speed at which the new candidate is followed up, not the recruiter’s skill. That we can control with automation. 
To make sure that best practices are being followed and that the ball doesn't get dropped when it comes to following up with candidates, Hire Up Funnels incorporate Check and Balance Rules. This automatically sends a reminder to the recruiter to contact the candidate, and if it happens twice in a row, the recruitment manager gets a notification that business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving them time to execute a backup plan so that a hiring deadline is not missed.  
Hire Up Funnels are just one piece of the AI-Powered Recruiter hiring system! AI-powered sourcing tools can scour the web, from job boards to social media platforms, to find potential candidates who may not have even applied for your job opening.
To put it simply, the AI-powered recruitment system can be broken down into three main functions to get more qualified canidates to your job offer. The first is the technology we use to engage and interact with your candidates throughout the recruitment cycle. Hire up funnels. The second function is our employer brand and recruitment messaging. based in phycology so you are talking to your candidates versus talking at your canidates. The third function is data driver recruitment. 
Despite the apparent complexity, the working of AI and automation in recruitment is based on the core principle of efficiency - reducing manual effort, accelerating the process, and enhancing the precision of hiring decisions. Yet, as I discovered, transitioning from traditional recruitment methods to AI-powered recruitment wasn't entirely smooth sailing. In the next section, I'll share my initial experiences and challenges in adopting AI for recruitment.
Section 3: The First Brush with AI in Recruitment and the Initial Challenges
As a seasoned professional in the transportation and logistics industry, I've weathered my fair share of storms. But nothing prepared me for the force of change brought on by AI in recruitment and retention. My first encounter with it was not as smooth as its promised precise operations. In fact, it was quite the opposite—a messy confluence of fear, uncertainty, and skepticism.
When the concept of AI-powered recruitment was first introduced to me, it felt like being handed the helm of a high-tech spaceship after years of navigating a traditional sailboat. The dashboard was replete with dials and buttons that I didn’t understand. Instead of the familiar compass and sextant, I was staring at advanced radar and GPS systems, promising unparalleled accuracy and efficiency.
It wasn't just the steep learning curve that was daunting; it was also the prevalent apprehension about AI—misgivings about machines taking over jobs and reducing the 'human touch' in processes, concerns about privacy and data security, and skepticism about the actual benefits of AI versus its cost.
As I struggled with these challenges, a realization dawned upon me. It wasn't the technology itself that was the obstacle; it was our resistance to change, our fear of the unknown. And it wasn't until I addressed these fears that I could unlock the true potential of AI in recruitment.
So, I embarked on a mission to dispel these fears and misconceptions, beginning with education. I reached out to experts, attended seminars, read widely on the subject, and even took online courses. I familiarized myself with AI jargon and how it worked, and as my understanding grew, so did my confidence.
Then came the task of convincing the rest of the team. There was significant resistance from the recruiters who feared that automation would render them obsolete. I reassured them that AI wouldn’t replace them but instead augment their capabilities. AI could take care of the time-consuming, repetitive administrative tasks, giving them more time to engage with the candidates and make informed decisions.
I also had to address concerns about data privacy. I ensured that the AI tools we used were compliant with data protection laws and that the candidates’ information was safe. We even decided to take a radical stance on AI decision-making tools. All hiring decisions will be made by human beings, people. As part of our Hybrid AI strategy. Our team will use the data from AI as just a part of the decision-making process, not the complete decision-making process. And if and when we use an automated decision-making AI tool. I will be certified as non-bias or will not use it. To protect us against any lawsuits. 
Finally, to tackle the skepticism about the benefits of AI, I decided to run a pilot project. We used an AI-powered automated recruitment funnel on a small scale to hire for a couple of roles. The results were impressive—the process was faster, the candidates were high quality, and the recruiters found they had more time to engage with the candidates.
The initial challenges in adopting AI for recruitment were not trivial but surmountable. And the payoff was worth the struggle. In the next section, we will delve into the insights gleaned from ""The Second Machine Age"" and ""Moneyball,"" both of which elucidate the power of data-driven strategies in recruitment.
Section 4: Insight into the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on Data-Driven Strategies
When I first picked up ""The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies"" by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, little did I know how profound an impact it would have on my approach to recruitment. The book unravels the transformative power of digital technologies and automation, arguing that we are at the dawn of a second machine age, marked by advancements that will dwarf those of the Industrial Revolution.
The core of the second machine age, as Brynjolfsson and McAfee outline, is the explosion of data. We live in a world overflowing with digital information, and the book posits that the organizations which can harvest and harness this data will be the victors of the new age. When correctly leveraged, data could generate insights and solutions that human intuition alone may fail to grasp.
For me, this message resonated deeply. The significance of data-driven decision-making in recruitment became clear as day. The thousands of resumes we sifted through, the endless interviews conducted—all generated data. Yet, were we utilizing this information effectively? Or were we just drowning in it, overwhelmed and unable to extract valuable insights?
Meanwhile, ""Moneyball,"" a movie based on the real-life story of the Oakland A's baseball team, served as a practical illustration of the power of data analytics. The team's manager, Billy Beane, frustrated by budget constraints and unable to compete with wealthier teams for star players, turned to data analytics to select undervalued players. His unconventional strategy turned the tide for his team and disrupted traditional methods of player selection.
The parallels with the recruitment industry were obvious. Like Billy Beane, we were vying for talent in a fiercely competitive market. And just as Beane used analytics to identify underappreciated talent, we too could leverage AI to unearth potential candidates overlooked by traditional recruitment methods. Moreover, data analytics could help us optimize our recruitment strategies, target our outreach more effectively, and make more informed hiring decisions.
Both ""The Second Machine Age"" and ""Moneyball"" drove home the message that those who wield data with dexterity are destined to succeed in the age of information. For us in the recruitment industry, AI and automation emerged not merely as buzzwords but as powerful tools to survive and thrive in the digital era.
Section 5: Conclusion - Harnessing AI & Automation for Recruitment Success
Looking back on my journey of embracing AI and automation in recruitment, I see a clear evolution—from initial skepticism and apprehension to acceptance and enthusiastic advocacy. My experiences with AI in recruitment have reshaped my perspectives and revolutionized our recruitment strategy, echoing the transformative power of technology highlighted in ""The Second Machine Age"" and the pivotal role of data-driven decision-making showcased in ""Moneyball.""
The recruitment landscape is undeniably shifting beneath our feet, with AI and automation ushering in a new era of efficiency, precision, and insight-driven decisions. With hybrid AI, the human touch will always remain an integral part of our recruitment strategy, there's no denying that AI has the potential to augment our abilities, improve our processes, and enhance our results.
With the AI-powered recruiter, you can speed up and streamline the recruitment process, freeing recruiters from the tedious, time-consuming administrative tasks to focus on what truly matters—building meaningful connections with potential hires. We can leverage machine learning algorithms to sift through massive data sets and identify patterns that might escape the human eye, enabling us to make more informed hiring decisions.
Furthermore, predictive analytics allows us to anticipate and address potential retention hurdles, enabling us to attract and retain talent more effectively. We can personalize our messaging and engagement, delivering tailored experiences that resonate with individual candidates and foster stronger relationships.
However, to harness the full potential of AI and automation, we must navigate the inevitable challenges that come with adopting new technology. Addressing fears, overcoming resistance, and ensuring data security are crucial steps in this journey. It's a journey marked by learning, adaptation, and resilience—a journey well worth embarking on, considering AI’s transformative impact on our recruitment and retention process.
AI and automation are not distant prospects of the future; they're here and now, ready to be leveraged by those willing to embrace change and innovation. As we stand at the brink of the second machine age, we have a choice—to shy away from the unfamiliar or to bravely venture into uncharted territories armed with the power of data and AI.
As I conclude this chapter, I invite you to choose the latter. Embrace the revolution of AI and automation in recruitment. Harness the power of data to navigate the turbulent seas of talent acquisition. And when you do, you'll find that you can weather the storm and chart a course to unparalleled success in recruitment.

Don't let their lack of urgency discourage you. Stay focused, keep pushing forward, and trust that the right opportunity will come at the perfect time. Your patience and perseverance will pay off. #StayMotivated #OpportunityKnocks",Chapter 3 Speed is what matters.,"I remember like it yesterday. I had landed a giant recruitment contract. But I did not know I was not the only recruitment company with the contract. They also contracted with one of my biggest competitors. 
The big company had more people and more resources, and they were using them to beat me out for all the placements. I was in the fight of my business life. They did not like me being there and were determined to push me out. I needed to make placements, or I would lose the contract, and the big company would win. 

So I decided I would use the shotgun approach. I upped my advertising budget again and did a text message campaign for the candidates that were on my list (candidates I own). It kind of worked, and kind of didn’t work... here is what I mean. The number of candidates that responded to our job posting & text message campaign increased.   

But the number of people we hired only increased for some recruiters and not others. The strange thing I noticed about the results is. I would have 2 recruiters with the same skill set and get two wildly different results from them. You would think the results would be similar to each other. It was frustrating...I suspected that something was up. If I could solve this puzzle, I could easily double my profits with the same number of resources, ad spend, and effort I am using now.  

I started searching for any study, report, or any bit of creditable information on what would cause such a difference in performance with two equally skilled recruiters. I read article after article clicking link after link in the articles for what seemed like weeks until I finally ended up finding a study by Harvard business review. I found a study on sales companies' response rates 
 

Our research shows that most companies are not responding nearly fast enough… our research indicates that many firms are too slow to follow up on these leads. We audited 2,241 U.S. companies…. 24% took more than 24 hours—and 23% of the companies never responded at all. The average response time…. was 42 hours.  
These results are especially shocking given how quickly online leads go cold. Firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times as likely to qualify the lead….as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later—and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer.”’ 
Source: Harvard Business Review 
https://timetoreply.com/harvard-business-review/ 
 
The first time I read the report, I thought it had valuable information. And I put the report in my file to read again. I continued my search, but I could not find anything that useful. A few weeks passed, and I picked up the Harvard business review report to read it again. When I finished reading the report, I came to a different conclusion. Have you ever experienced that? You get a different message from the same report or book on a different read. 

This time reading the report, I realized the variable for success was not the sales skill of the salesperson. The variable for success was the speed at which the salesperson responded to the lead. Only after the salesperson was talking to a prospect did the sales skill come into play. 

I wondered if that was happening with my recruitment team. It would explain the discrepancy between the two recruiters with similar skills. With these market conditions, candidates rule the hiring process. Who knows. First, I needed to know how fast we respond to new candidates. To do that, we had to pull reporting from our phone system. And reporting from our hire-up funnel software and cross reference that will the call report to get the full picture. We broke it down by each recruiter extension and transfer.  

Here is what we uncovered each recruiter handled their new candidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason on how my recruiters responded to the new canidates they received from our advertising.  As we studied the data, a pattern started to emerge. We cross-referenced that with the placements report, and my suspicions were confirmed.  

Some of our recruiters responded to new canidates on the day they applied and they filled a lot more jobs than the recruiters that responded the following day or the following two days. There was a direct correlation between how fast a call, text, or resume was responded to by a recruiter. And the total number of people hired by that recruiter. 

The Harvard Business Review Report proved to ring true in recruiting candidates from the Internet. This means we lost a lot of candidates, which cost a lot of money. And wasted a lot of our recruiter's time following up trying to get these canidates on the phone to qualify. All because we delayed responding to new canidates one day. Is your team doing the same thing?  

Section 1 Ghosting Canidates 

That reminded me of a project we did for a client. They were having all kinds of issues with their hiring. So we did a survey of all the candidates they did not hire, and the results were eye-opening 30% of the candidates said that the recruiter ghosted them. Almost half of the ghosted candidates said it happened more than two times.    
 
This damaged their employer's brand. And can have a negative effect on future candidates from applying. It is critical that candidate ghosting does not happen. And adequate and appropriate feedback given to job seekers. No matter what stage of the hiring process they are in.    
 
Reshaping recruitment and retention is all about human interaction. It is not just about AI or an online experience; it has a human element. So, you must integrate human interaction with technology and AI to achieve the greatest results, hybrid AI. I worked with the team to determine the best way to respond to new candidates from our advertising. After weeks of trial and error. We tested different timelines on hundreds of new candidates from our advertising.   
 
AI crunched the data and showed that if we returned our candidates' first call. Text, application or resume within 15 minutes. We were six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. The team agreed that 15 minutes was a reasonable time to respond. So that became the new business rule.    
 
Section 2 Check & Balance:  

After that experience, I realized I needed a check and balance system. To ensure that my recruiters were treating each and every candidate the same. And the system informs the management team when business processes are not being followed. Or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure you do not miss a hiring deadline. To carry out this. We use check and balance rules in the workflow that could not be possible without automation with decision logic.    
 
Having check and balance rules in Hire up Funnels was an eye-opening experience for me. Before we put our check and balance in the workflow. We had no way to measure how our recruitment team followed up with canidates. Just like most of you.    
 
I did not know how long it took our recruiters to respond to new candidates from our advertising. Or if they were getting ghosted, It was like flying blind. With our check and balance rules. You will know if all your business’s best practices and recruitment rules are followed. Ensuring recruiter efficacy and good candidate experience. like flying with instruments, you know if you are on course or not, so you can correct and get back on track.    
 
Here is how the check and balance rules work. If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. Call a candidate back within 15 min of receiving a new candidate. The check and balance workflow would send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task and e-mail. Ensure a prompt callback and make sure the new candidate is not ghosted.    
 
Suppose this happens two times in a row. And the candidate is not called within the time limit of our business rules. In that case, the workflow sends a notification to the assigned recruitment manager. Who can then figure out why the new candidate. That you spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules. For the highest advertising-to-interview conversion ratio.    
 
Ensuring all candidates get a great experience. You are more productive; you hire more of the qualified candidates you are already talking to. The Hire Up funnels workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate. So, you hire more of the qualified canidates you are already talking to. Never worry if your team is not following best practices and rules. Our check and balance rules will keep you informed.   

After giving our team the information and tools to improve their results. Our team now has an average 5-minute response time to new candidates from our advertising. All recruiters have increased the number of hires. Some so much that you would not believe me if I shared them with you. Check and balance rules can carry out various tasks. We use several versions throughout our Hire Up Funnels.   
 
Section 3 Follow up programmed in check and balance rules.    
 
I wanted to beat the big company for the most placements badly. I dug a little deeper in the data and started to see a new pattern. I shared it with the team, and they confirmed it. When a candidate calls, text, or submit a resume. And if the call went to voicemail or a text was not returned, that started a domino effect of complications. The most time-consuming was the never-ending game of phone tag. To get the candidate back on the phone or respond to your text so you could activate. And start the recruitment process of qualification.    
 
I returned to my Hire up Funnels software and pulled reporting of follow-up attempts. To successful calls where we got the candidate on the phone to do the prescreening call to qualify. And move to the next stage of the recruitment cycle success path. 
 
The results were like the new candidate from advertising results. Every recruiter handled the new canidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason for how many follow-up calls a recruiter made. Everyone on the team had a different number of follow-up calls. We shared the results with the team. The high-performing recruiters made more follow-up calls than the low-performer ones. The report told us that 20% of the team gave up after only two follow-up attempts. That was disappointing...   
 
I shared the results with the team to see the best way to fix this. The recruiters that responded with the least number of follow-up calls. Shared some very valuable information with us. The main reason for not making as many follow-up calls. Was that they felt like they were pestering the candidates. And felt like they were being pushy. I can understand that.    
 
So, the big question was. How many times should candidates be called for the best contact, qualification, and hiring ratios? And so, your team knows the number of calls to make that they are not bothering candidates. So, we tested the candidates we had. To see the correct number of follow-ups. To get a candidate that responded to our job advertisement. On the phone who did not answer the recruiters' first return call.   
 
We tested calling, texting, and sending e-mails, and pixel targeting. It was surprising to learn that you must do much more follow-up than one would think for a job.  But you do not want to overdo it, burn out your candidates, and destroy your reputation in your market. The sweet spot is to be persistent but not a stalker. The stats told us that we needed to follow up seven. To eight times to get a candidate activated on the phone (without upsetting them). To do a prescreen call and qualify.    
 
Digging even deeper into the data. We also discovered that if we did not get the candidate on the phone in the first seven days after applying with us. They went cold and non-responsive. The tests we ran told us we got more people on the phone to prescreen. And qualify if we used a combination of phone calls and text messages, and e-mails.    
 
On a fluke my lead recruiter suggested that we try using our AI chatbot in our follow-up messages. To give our canidates the option to use the AI chatbot to book time to talk to the recruiter, and boy, did they.   
 
Section 4 Follow-up rules.    
 
We added follow-up rules to our check and balance workflow with that data. When the recruiter calls the new candidate back, the call is unanswered. We have a control requiring eight follow-ups for every new candidate not activated. The recruiter calls the candidate every other day for eight days. When the recruiter does not call. We set up the workflow to send our omnichannel communication.    
 
This way, we reach out to our candidate eight times in six days. With four calls from the recruiter and four automated Omni channel communication. Including AI chatbots, to schedule a call with a recruiter. Increasing the efficiency of our recruitment team. Getting more people on the phone. And into the qualification stage of the recruitment cycle.    
 
If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. The workflow would automatically send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task in their calendar and e-mail. If your recruiter does not adhere to the follow-up rules. Another reminder task is sent if this happens twice in a row. The candidate is not called within the time frame of our business rules. Then the workflow sends a notification. To the assigned recruitment manager. Who can figure out why the new candidate. That we spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules time frame.    
 
 
Ensure all candidates have a great recruitment experience. And we are more productive, so we hire more of the qualified candidates we are already talking to. The recruitment funnel workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate.  
 
Section 5 Conclusion 
 
Here is how important a good candidate's experience is. According to career plug. 80% of candidates said that a positive candidate experience influenced their decision to say yes to an offer. 58% of job seekers said that a poor candidate experience led them to decline a job.    
https://www.careerplug.com/blog/improve-hiring-with-better-communication/  
 
So, I adjusted my funnel with the check and balance rules of 15 min to return a call. And programed eight follow ups for every new candidate and relaunched it. Did some optimization and the team started to hire more people. We started to beat the big company for placements. With the same resources I was spending before I made the changes to the check and balance rules. It was an all-out war for the top spot. One week they would take the top spot, and the next week, we would take the top spot. This went on for several weeks, the competition was fierce. It was technology strategy versus strength, who would win?    
 
With a dedicated team and the right tools. We were able to track, measure and optimize our recruitment funnels. To become number one, we held the top spot to the end of the recruitment contract. Technology strategy wins over strength every time...    
 
Success is achieved by adjusting technology. To accommodate human behavior opened a whole new world for me. What else can I do to gain market advantage? So, I studied the biggest technology companies. To figure out how they grew so fast and became market leaders.   
 
Remember, there is something much bigger at play here than just data. As the data increases and the metrics become more trackable, It is easy to get sucked into the analytics of it all. And in the process, forget that there is a person on the other side of the metrics. A person with a problem, a person who needs you to solve their problem.

Discover the top 3 reasons holding you back from expanding your fleet & boosting retention rates. Don't miss out on this valuable insight! #trucking #driverretention #recruitment #AI #data,Introduction,"Picture this: A time in the not-so-distant future where job applications are screened, shortlisted, interviewed, and hired, not by human beings, but by artificial intelligence. Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

Embrace this game-changing technology to elevate your recruitment efforts! #AIRevolution #DriverRecruitment",Introduction,"Picture this: A time in the not-so-distant future where job applications are screened, shortlisted, interviewed, and hired, not by human beings, but by artificial intelligence. Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

Let's navigate the hiring highway together and solve your driver recruitment problems! 💪💼  #LogisticsPros #HiringSolutions (PC: erwanhesry, Unsplash)",2 Navigating the Hiring Highway,"Over two decades ago. When I first entered the fascinating world of trucking and logistics recruitment. It was a different era. Hiring was a straightforward process back then. Even rudimentary compared to today's standards. The industry was growing, and jobs were plentiful. Looking back, those were the days of simplicity in the hiring landscape.


But as the adage goes, ""Change is the only constant."" The tides of time swirled, and so did the logistics and trucking industry. The big problem was the driver shortage. A persistent thorn in the side of an industry otherwise buzzing with opportunity. It felt like being stranded on a highway with a truck full of promises but no drivers to steer it.


I struggled with this relentless challenge. Brainstorming strategies to attract and retain the drivers we hired. At times, it seemed like an impossible task. But I wasn't alone. The entire industry was facing the same predicament. We started the AI revolution. And industries worldwide were turning to technology as their savior. Intrigued and inspired, I contemplated if AI could be our knight in shining armor.


The world event that revolutionized hiring was the adoption of Chat GPT. This is the first time a technology with the power to change the world has been given to the world for free…. Thanks to Open AI 


It happened slowly at first (100 million new users within the first week), but its impact was profound. Companies using AI and automation were beating out companies not using AI. Companies started using AI-powered recruitment systems to automate recruitment workflows. And automate communication through omnichannel. They even had ways to inform you how fast your recruitment team is—returned canidates calls and texts. Ensuring the best canidates to application ratio. And no canidates get ghosted, providing a great candidate experience. So, more of your qualified candidates make it to your job offer. Giving your team the canidates needed to make the best job-to-candidate match. 


From the shadows of this transformation emerged a glimmer of hope. Could we, too, harness the power of technology to tackle our recruitment woes? The promise was enticing, and the opportunity immense.


In this chapter, we'll traverse the hiring highway. Shedding light on traditional hiring methods. And exploring the role of technology in modern hiring processes. We'll delve into my personal journey and how my perspective on hiring has evolved. Drawing inspiration from the book. ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" and the movie. ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" we'll learn to identify talent and overcome adversity. Buckle up, for an enlightening ride awaits us on the hiring highway.


Section 1 - Analysis of traditional hiring methods in the trucking industry


Steering back to the beginning of my career. Hiring in the trucking industry was an art. Rooted in gut feelings, intuition, and personal judgment. Candidates were assessed based on their ability to handle a truck. Commitment to the job and willingness to spend long hours on the road. They were face-to-face interactions, handshake deals, and decisions made around the coffee table. It was all incredibly human and intensely personal.


The process took time and was often hit-or-miss. While we celebrated when we found the right fit, it was back to square one when we didn't. It was challenging to assess a candidate's commitment. Adaptability and resilience through an interview or two. Our assessment was based on their past driving record and the charm of their personality.


Furthermore, the hiring process was localized. We relied on local talent pools or word-of-mouth referrals. Our go-to recruitment strategy was placing a help-wanted ad in the local newspaper on Wednesday or Sunday. Or at the town job fair to fill positions. In some ways, it was comforting and familiar. But it was also limiting.


This traditional approach began showing its cracks as the industry grew more competitive. Trucking is about more than driving from point A to point B. It's about adhering to tight schedules. Maintaining the vehicle and managing on-road challenges. Ensuring the safe and timely delivery of goods. While being a customer service rep and face of the company. Most importantly, it's about doing all this. Day in and day out, while providing a great customer experience. 


These complexities were often overlooked in traditional hiring practices. As a result, we ended up hiring drivers who were good at driving but needed help with the other aspects of the job. The result? High turnover rates and a constant struggle to keep our complete fleet on the road.


As I navigated these challenges, I saw the need for a more robust. Comprehensive hiring strategy. That considered a candidate’s driving skills with suitability for the job. The seeds of change were sown. But what I needed was a game changer. A revolutionary approach that would take our hiring strategy from basic to brilliant.


Section 2 - The Role of Technology in modern hiring processes


The AI (artificial intelligence) Technology revolution began to assert its role. During this quest for a new approach. Inspired by industries that were integrating AI. In their hiring practices, I pondered upon their potential in ours.


As we dove deeper into the realm of technology. We discovered a world brimming with possibilities. Candidate Relation Management Systems (CRM) Built on advanced automation platforms. Equipped with AI capabilities, they were revolutionizing the way hiring was done. 


The sophisticated system had four different advanced automation systems running in the background. To provide your team with the right tools. And approach to streamline the recruitment processes. It promised recruiter efficiency accuracy. And a significant reduction in time-to-hire by delivering a great candidate experience. 


Moreover, data-driven hiring became a possibility. We could analyze historical data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. AI brought the power of predictive analytics. Enabling us to foresee hiring trends, expect needs, and plan. We could answer critical questions like: What traits do our best drivers share? What makes a driver stay with us for the long term?


Additionally, AI-powered chatbots. And virtual reality tools opened avenues for a more engaging candidate experience. Prospective drivers could interact with chatbots to get immediate answers to their queries. Virtual reality could give them a realistic job simulation, leading to better-informed decisions.


The role of technology in modern hiring processes. It extends beyond finding and hiring the right candidate. It also played a significant part in onboarding and retaining the hired talent. Technology has kept the drivers engaged. And committed easier, from AI-assisted onboarding programs to regular check-ins and feedback loops.


Looking at all these possibilities, I was in awe of how technology could be a game changer. It had the potential to address the very issues we had been struggling with. It was a revolutionary, data-driven, and efficient approach to an age-old problem. As I stood on the brink of this technological revolution, I was convinced that this was the path we needed to tread.


Section 3 - My journey and the evolution of my perspective on hiring


In my journey from a recruiter to the top AI Recruitment and Retention strategist for the trucking and logistics industry. I've weathered many storms and celebrated countless victories. Each phase offered a learning experience and altered my perspective on hiring.


I started my career two decades ago, and hiring was personal. Hiring is based on a face-to-face interview and a person’s willingness to work hard. It was the age of intuition-based hiring. That's not to say it was flawed - I was a testament to its success. But as I moved up the ladder, I realized it was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.


I remember a time in the early stages of my recruitment career. When we were struggling with high turnover. We had a team of hard-working drivers, but they weren't staying. The strain of long hours, tight schedules, and road challenges was taking its toll. This was my first brush with the limitations of traditional hiring methods.


I realized then that hiring for the trucking industry needed more than intuition. It required understanding the complexities of the job and assessing the candidate's capability to handle them. It was about hiring drivers who wouldn't drive but thrive in today's high-pressure, challenging trucking environment.


As I wrestled with these challenges. I discovered the potential of technology to transform our hiring process. What seemed like a daunting, almost alien concept started making sense. The more I delved into it. The more I saw its potential to streamline our hiring, expand our reach, and improve our success rate.


My journey through the adoption of AI in hiring. It echoed the broader AI revolution that was transforming industries worldwide. It was a period of rapid evolution and change. Companies that embraced AI. And advanced automation was propelling ahead. At the same time, those who resisted AI and advanced automation were falling behind.


In this whirlwind of change, I found inspiration in the book. ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. They advocated a data-driven, structured approach to hiring. - a methodology that could potentially revolutionize our hiring process. I also found motivation in the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness.” The protagonist's resilience, commitment, and relentless pursuit of his dream. Were a reflection of the kind of drivers we wanted to hire. 


These influences shaped my perspective. They were leading me to understand that the key to successful hiring. It lies in a harmonious blend of technology and human touch. Humanity was becoming the new technology. I realized that while AI. Automation could do much of the heavy lifting. The human element was critical for connection in making the final call. After all, it was about finding people who would be the face of our company on the road. 


Section 4 - Learning from the reference book and movie, focusing on identifying talent and overcoming adversity.


I found valuable lessons in ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. The book gave me the tools to chart a course in the tumultuous seas of hiring. Mainly, as it focused on hiring for attitude and potential, they emphasized that it's not always about qualifications or experience. It's about who they are as individuals. And whether they align with the company's values and culture.


Their concept of the A player - an employee with at least a 90 percent chance of achieving a set of outcomes. That only the top 10 percent of possible candidates could achieve - resonated deeply. The A player for us was a driver who not only drove. But also represented our company's values was the face of our company. Maintained strong customer relationships and upheld the highest safety standards.


But, finding these A players required a change in our hiring approach. We needed to look beyond the driving skills. And delve deeper into their attitude, resilience, and potential. We needed a structured, data-driven approach. That combined technology and human intuition. Hybrid AI for hiring the perfect blend of artificial and emotional intelligence. 


This reminded me of how AI gave Wall Street Firms an edge over the competition. But, when AI became widely adopted, this advantage faded. This is where Quants, the heroes of Wall Street, stepped in. They brought forth a revolutionary approach, Hybrid AI, using the best human intelligence paired with artificial intelligence. The firms that adopted this approach were the Quants. Pulled ahead of the competition, redefining the leaders on Wall Street. 


Wall Street’s evolution parallels the current state of. Recruitment and retention as quants disrupted Wall Street with Hybrid AI. AI Recruitment and Retention Strategists are becoming the “quants” of HR. We are using Hybrid AI for hiring to improve recruitment. And retention in the trucking and logistics industry. Where humans make the final decision aided by the data from AI. 


This is where the lessons from the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" came into play. The protagonist, Chris Gardner, was the embodiment of resilience and determination. He had limited resources and opportunities. Yet his unyielding determination to provide for his son. And pursue his dream job was inspiring.


Gardner was a perfect example of an A player. He didn't have the qualifications or experience. But his attitude and resilience were unmatched. He was the kind of driver we wanted. One who would persist through challenges remains committed to the job. And continuously strive for excellence.


The movie was a stark reminder that adversities can be overcome with a resilient spirit. And a relentless pursuit of happiness. It was a reflection of the challenges our drivers faced: long hours, road hazards, solitude. And yet, with the right attitude and support, they could overcome them.


Bringing these lessons into our hiring process, we reshaped our strategy. We deployed AI tools to screen for skill-based parameters. Freeing us to focus on personal traits during interviews. We looked for qualities like resilience, determination. And a positive attitude, which we had overlooked in our traditional hiring approach.


We started conducting behavioral interviews. Posing situational questions to assess how they would react in challenging scenarios. How did they handle a tough delivery? How did they cope with the solitude on long hauls? How did they deal with demanding customers or situations?


We began to see a change as we integrated these lessons into our hiring process. Our hiring decisions were becoming more informed. Our driver pool was strengthening, and our retention rates were improving. We were making headway in our battle with the driver shortage.


Section 5 - Conclusion: Navigating the Road Ahead


The transformation in our hybrid AI for hiring recruitment approach. Was not an overnight occurrence; it was a journey paved with trials, errors, and learnings. These changes were essential and long overdue. Not just for our company but for the trucking industry as a whole.


The lessons we learned, the improvements we made. And the progress we saw were encouraging. We turned the wheels of our recruitment process away from traditional. Limiting hiring practices towards a future defined by innovation, inclusivity, and intelligence. We succeeded in integrating the nuances of our industry. The essence of our drivers, and the power of technology into our hybrid AI hiring system.


Yet, as with any journey, ours is ongoing, and we continue to learn, adapt, and evolve. We are by no means perfect, and the driver shortage problem is far from resolved. But we are better than the competition, and that's what matters.


The AI revolution is reshaping recruitment and retention in the trucking industry. And its adoption is not a matter of” if” but “when.” The driver shortage is a pressing issue requiring immediate attention and creative solutions. Advanced technology, AI. And automation present themselves as a powerful allies in this fight. If you can connect the dots of strategy to use AI and advanced automation for you. 


Technology integration in our hiring process has offered us insights. Solutions, and opportunities we could not have imagined. It has allowed us to explore a wealth of untapped potential. And resources that can be game-changers in our industry.


However, technology is only a too. Its successful implementation and impact depend on the user. A hammer in the hands of a child is merely a toy, but in the hands of Michelangelo, it can create masterpieces. Similarly, AI and automation can transform the recruitment landscape in our industry. But only if used strategically and wisely.


And in this endeavor, empathy and understanding are our guiding lights. It's about remembering that behind every applicatio and resume is a person. With hopes, dreams, fears, and responsibilities. It's about knowing that a driver is not just a driver. But an ambassador of our company, a custodian of our goods, and a crucial link in our economic chain.


I implore other industry leaders, HR professionals. And transport managers to embrace this new dawn, challenge traditional norms. And navigate uncharted territories. The road ahead is uncertain and filled with challenges and opportunities alike. But suppose we navigate it together, sharing insights, learnings, and best practices. In that case, we can shape a future where driver shortages are a thing of the past. And the industry thrives with committed, competent, and content drivers.


Let this chapter serve as an invitation to embark on this transformative journey. Where technology meets talent acquisition. Remember, it's not merely surviving the driver shortage but thriving through it.


Action Steps:






1. Challenge the Norms: Question your existing recruitment practices. Are they effective? Are they limiting your pool of potential drivers?


2. Adopt Technology: Embrace the use of AI and automation in your hiring process. Use them to streamline processes, broaden your search, and facilitate better decision-making.


3. Focus on the Person, Not Just the skills: Look beyond driving skills and qualifications. Assess attitudes, values, and potential. Remember, you're hiring a person, not just a driver.


4. Learn and Adapt: Stay updated with industry trends, technological advancements, and best practices. Learn from others and be willing to adapt your processes accordingly.


5. Share Your Insights: Don't keep your learnings to yourself. Share them with others in the industry. Remember, we're in this together.

Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.

What you need to do is to take the 96 Hour Book Challenge, and you'll be on your way.

WE USE AI!!!!!


Although I just want you to remember, technology, especially AI, should never be a shortcut—it should be an enhancer. 

You wouldn't want a steak cooked in the microwave for three minutes, would you? So, let's slow-cook your success on the grill, infusing it with the steak butter, rosemary and thyme we need for all the flavors of your raw resources.

Remember, ALWAYS START with the end in mind. 

So who is this book for?

If you're a speaker, coach, author, or thought leader feeling underappreciated and unseen in the market, this book is for you.

Most people don't have the success that they want. That is because they are not fit, they are not millionaire fit. Just like how you get fit in the gym, you can also become a millionaire fit…

Writing a book and making a million dollars might sound tough, but it's as easy as flipping a 500 pound tire… when you've got the right resources and mindset. It's time to flip the tire, make that financial win, and turn yourself into a brand rockstar.

I'm a big fitness guy. I believe that the discipline and motivation it takes to be successful in the gym is what can launch you to success in becoming a One Book Millionaire.. It's all about using your inherent raw resources to achieve maximum results.

Your raw resources are your experiences, expertise, and personality. Throughout this journey, you'll learn the importance of  using your raw resources in achieving success. 

Notice that I didn't say, what's in your bank account, what certification you have or a PhD, the history of your family, what house you're in, or what car you drive… NONE OF THAT SHIT MATTERS. You only need to harness the power of your raw resources.

I can share with you that I've sold $20,000 programs with just a Google doc and a Stripe link, all because I knew one thing: how to harness my raw resources.

What do I mean by being R.A.W.? 

Real Transparency
Authenticity
Willingness to be vulnerable

Be authentic and transparent. That's the key.

Get RAW. 

So what are your R.E.S.O.U.R.C.E.S?

Relatable Stories
Experience
Skillset
Open Communication
Unwavering Commitment
Resourcefulness
Collaboration
Empathy
Strategic Planning

Harness your power using your R.E.S.O.U.R.C.E.S.

This book will show you how to stop underestimating the value of these resources and leverage them to create a powerful, authentic, and transparent narrative.

Are you ready to stop wasting time?

Are you ready to live the life of your dreams?

Are you ready to finally become the coach you know you are always meant to be and make the kind of money that you know you're always meant to make?

Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

Innovative tools speed up recruitment, ensuring seamless journey to build dream team. Embrace future hiring with confidence and efficiency!",Chapter 3 Speed is what matters.,"I remember like it yesterday. I had landed a giant recruitment contract. But I did not know I was not the only recruitment company with the contract. They also contracted with one of my biggest competitors. 
The big company had more people and more resources, and they were using them to beat me out for all the placements. I was in the fight of my business life. They did not like me being there and were determined to push me out. I needed to make placements, or I would lose the contract, and the big company would win. 

So I decided I would use the shotgun approach. I upped my advertising budget again and did a text message campaign for the candidates that were on my list (candidates I own). It kind of worked, and kind of didn’t work... here is what I mean. The number of candidates that responded to our job posting & text message campaign increased.   

But the number of people we hired only increased for some recruiters and not others. The strange thing I noticed about the results is. I would have 2 recruiters with the same skill set and get two wildly different results from them. You would think the results would be similar to each other. It was frustrating...I suspected that something was up. If I could solve this puzzle, I could easily double my profits with the same number of resources, ad spend, and effort I am using now.  

I started searching for any study, report, or any bit of creditable information on what would cause such a difference in performance with two equally skilled recruiters. I read article after article clicking link after link in the articles for what seemed like weeks until I finally ended up finding a study by Harvard business review. I found a study on sales companies' response rates 
 

Our research shows that most companies are not responding nearly fast enough… our research indicates that many firms are too slow to follow up on these leads. We audited 2,241 U.S. companies…. 24% took more than 24 hours—and 23% of the companies never responded at all. The average response time…. was 42 hours.  
These results are especially shocking given how quickly online leads go cold. Firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times as likely to qualify the lead….as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later—and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer.”’ 
Source: Harvard Business Review 
https://timetoreply.com/harvard-business-review/ 
 
The first time I read the report, I thought it had valuable information. And I put the report in my file to read again. I continued my search, but I could not find anything that useful. A few weeks passed, and I picked up the Harvard business review report to read it again. When I finished reading the report, I came to a different conclusion. Have you ever experienced that? You get a different message from the same report or book on a different read. 

This time reading the report, I realized the variable for success was not the sales skill of the salesperson. The variable for success was the speed at which the salesperson responded to the lead. Only after the salesperson was talking to a prospect did the sales skill come into play. 

I wondered if that was happening with my recruitment team. It would explain the discrepancy between the two recruiters with similar skills. With these market conditions, candidates rule the hiring process. Who knows. First, I needed to know how fast we respond to new candidates. To do that, we had to pull reporting from our phone system. And reporting from our hire-up funnel software and cross reference that will the call report to get the full picture. We broke it down by each recruiter extension and transfer.  

Here is what we uncovered each recruiter handled their new candidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason on how my recruiters responded to the new canidates they received from our advertising.  As we studied the data, a pattern started to emerge. We cross-referenced that with the placements report, and my suspicions were confirmed.  

Some of our recruiters responded to new canidates on the day they applied and they filled a lot more jobs than the recruiters that responded the following day or the following two days. There was a direct correlation between how fast a call, text, or resume was responded to by a recruiter. And the total number of people hired by that recruiter. 

The Harvard Business Review Report proved to ring true in recruiting candidates from the Internet. This means we lost a lot of candidates, which cost a lot of money. And wasted a lot of our recruiter's time following up trying to get these canidates on the phone to qualify. All because we delayed responding to new canidates one day. Is your team doing the same thing?  

Section 1 Ghosting Canidates 

That reminded me of a project we did for a client. They were having all kinds of issues with their hiring. So we did a survey of all the candidates they did not hire, and the results were eye-opening 30% of the candidates said that the recruiter ghosted them. Almost half of the ghosted candidates said it happened more than two times.    
 
This damaged their employer's brand. And can have a negative effect on future candidates from applying. It is critical that candidate ghosting does not happen. And adequate and appropriate feedback given to job seekers. No matter what stage of the hiring process they are in.    
 
Reshaping recruitment and retention is all about human interaction. It is not just about AI or an online experience; it has a human element. So, you must integrate human interaction with technology and AI to achieve the greatest results, hybrid AI. I worked with the team to determine the best way to respond to new candidates from our advertising. After weeks of trial and error. We tested different timelines on hundreds of new candidates from our advertising.   
 
AI crunched the data and showed that if we returned our candidates' first call. Text, application or resume within 15 minutes. We were six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. The team agreed that 15 minutes was a reasonable time to respond. So that became the new business rule.    
 
Section 2 Check & Balance:  

After that experience, I realized I needed a check and balance system. To ensure that my recruiters were treating each and every candidate the same. And the system informs the management team when business processes are not being followed. Or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure you do not miss a hiring deadline. To carry out this. We use check and balance rules in the workflow that could not be possible without automation with decision logic.    
 
Having check and balance rules in Hire up Funnels was an eye-opening experience for me. Before we put our check and balance in the workflow. We had no way to measure how our recruitment team followed up with canidates. Just like most of you.    
 
I did not know how long it took our recruiters to respond to new candidates from our advertising. Or if they were getting ghosted, It was like flying blind. With our check and balance rules. You will know if all your business’s best practices and recruitment rules are followed. Ensuring recruiter efficacy and good candidate experience. like flying with instruments, you know if you are on course or not, so you can correct and get back on track.    
 
Here is how the check and balance rules work. If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. Call a candidate back within 15 min of receiving a new candidate. The check and balance workflow would send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task and e-mail. Ensure a prompt callback and make sure the new candidate is not ghosted.    
 
Suppose this happens two times in a row. And the candidate is not called within the time limit of our business rules. In that case, the workflow sends a notification to the assigned recruitment manager. Who can then figure out why the new candidate. That you spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules. For the highest advertising-to-interview conversion ratio.    
 
Ensuring all candidates get a great experience. You are more productive; you hire more of the qualified candidates you are already talking to. The Hire Up funnels workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate. So, you hire more of the qualified canidates you are already talking to. Never worry if your team is not following best practices and rules. Our check and balance rules will keep you informed.   

After giving our team the information and tools to improve their results. Our team now has an average 5-minute response time to new candidates from our advertising. All recruiters have increased the number of hires. Some so much that you would not believe me if I shared them with you. Check and balance rules can carry out various tasks. We use several versions throughout our Hire Up Funnels.   
 
Section 3 Follow up programmed in check and balance rules.    
 
I wanted to beat the big company for the most placements badly. I dug a little deeper in the data and started to see a new pattern. I shared it with the team, and they confirmed it. When a candidate calls, text, or submit a resume. And if the call went to voicemail or a text was not returned, that started a domino effect of complications. The most time-consuming was the never-ending game of phone tag. To get the candidate back on the phone or respond to your text so you could activate. And start the recruitment process of qualification.    
 
I returned to my Hire up Funnels software and pulled reporting of follow-up attempts. To successful calls where we got the candidate on the phone to do the prescreening call to qualify. And move to the next stage of the recruitment cycle success path. 
 
The results were like the new candidate from advertising results. Every recruiter handled the new canidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason for how many follow-up calls a recruiter made. Everyone on the team had a different number of follow-up calls. We shared the results with the team. The high-performing recruiters made more follow-up calls than the low-performer ones. The report told us that 20% of the team gave up after only two follow-up attempts. That was disappointing...   
 
I shared the results with the team to see the best way to fix this. The recruiters that responded with the least number of follow-up calls. Shared some very valuable information with us. The main reason for not making as many follow-up calls. Was that they felt like they were pestering the candidates. And felt like they were being pushy. I can understand that.    
 
So, the big question was. How many times should candidates be called for the best contact, qualification, and hiring ratios? And so, your team knows the number of calls to make that they are not bothering candidates. So, we tested the candidates we had. To see the correct number of follow-ups. To get a candidate that responded to our job advertisement. On the phone who did not answer the recruiters' first return call.   
 
We tested calling, texting, and sending e-mails, and pixel targeting. It was surprising to learn that you must do much more follow-up than one would think for a job.  But you do not want to overdo it, burn out your candidates, and destroy your reputation in your market. The sweet spot is to be persistent but not a stalker. The stats told us that we needed to follow up seven. To eight times to get a candidate activated on the phone (without upsetting them). To do a prescreen call and qualify.    
 
Digging even deeper into the data. We also discovered that if we did not get the candidate on the phone in the first seven days after applying with us. They went cold and non-responsive. The tests we ran told us we got more people on the phone to prescreen. And qualify if we used a combination of phone calls and text messages, and e-mails.    
 
On a fluke my lead recruiter suggested that we try using our AI chatbot in our follow-up messages. To give our canidates the option to use the AI chatbot to book time to talk to the recruiter, and boy, did they.   
 
Section 4 Follow-up rules.    
 
We added follow-up rules to our check and balance workflow with that data. When the recruiter calls the new candidate back, the call is unanswered. We have a control requiring eight follow-ups for every new candidate not activated. The recruiter calls the candidate every other day for eight days. When the recruiter does not call. We set up the workflow to send our omnichannel communication.    
 
This way, we reach out to our candidate eight times in six days. With four calls from the recruiter and four automated Omni channel communication. Including AI chatbots, to schedule a call with a recruiter. Increasing the efficiency of our recruitment team. Getting more people on the phone. And into the qualification stage of the recruitment cycle.    
 
If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. The workflow would automatically send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task in their calendar and e-mail. If your recruiter does not adhere to the follow-up rules. Another reminder task is sent if this happens twice in a row. The candidate is not called within the time frame of our business rules. Then the workflow sends a notification. To the assigned recruitment manager. Who can figure out why the new candidate. That we spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules time frame.    
 
 
Ensure all candidates have a great recruitment experience. And we are more productive, so we hire more of the qualified candidates we are already talking to. The recruitment funnel workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate.  
 
Section 5 Conclusion 
 
Here is how important a good candidate's experience is. According to career plug. 80% of candidates said that a positive candidate experience influenced their decision to say yes to an offer. 58% of job seekers said that a poor candidate experience led them to decline a job.    
https://www.careerplug.com/blog/improve-hiring-with-better-communication/  
 
So, I adjusted my funnel with the check and balance rules of 15 min to return a call. And programed eight follow ups for every new candidate and relaunched it. Did some optimization and the team started to hire more people. We started to beat the big company for placements. With the same resources I was spending before I made the changes to the check and balance rules. It was an all-out war for the top spot. One week they would take the top spot, and the next week, we would take the top spot. This went on for several weeks, the competition was fierce. It was technology strategy versus strength, who would win?    
 
With a dedicated team and the right tools. We were able to track, measure and optimize our recruitment funnels. To become number one, we held the top spot to the end of the recruitment contract. Technology strategy wins over strength every time...    
 
Success is achieved by adjusting technology. To accommodate human behavior opened a whole new world for me. What else can I do to gain market advantage? So, I studied the biggest technology companies. To figure out how they grew so fast and became market leaders.   
 
Remember, there is something much bigger at play here than just data. As the data increases and the metrics become more trackable, It is easy to get sucked into the analytics of it all. And in the process, forget that there is a person on the other side of the metrics. A person with a problem, a person who needs you to solve their problem.

Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.

By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

From outdated methods to understanding millennials and Gen Z, we've got you covered! Don't miss out on attracting passive job seekers. 💼",Introduction,"Picture this: A time in the not-so-distant future where job applications are screened, shortlisted, interviewed, and hired, not by human beings, but by artificial intelligence. Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.

Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

Don't miss out on the best practices! We'll guide you to find the perfect fit for your team. Reach out today to revolutionize your hiring strategy!,Chapter 3 Speed is what matters.,"I remember like it yesterday. I had landed a giant recruitment contract. But I did not know I was not the only recruitment company with the contract. They also contracted with one of my biggest competitors. 
The big company had more people and more resources, and they were using them to beat me out for all the placements. I was in the fight of my business life. They did not like me being there and were determined to push me out. I needed to make placements, or I would lose the contract, and the big company would win. 

So I decided I would use the shotgun approach. I upped my advertising budget again and did a text message campaign for the candidates that were on my list (candidates I own). It kind of worked, and kind of didn’t work... here is what I mean. The number of candidates that responded to our job posting & text message campaign increased.   

But the number of people we hired only increased for some recruiters and not others. The strange thing I noticed about the results is. I would have 2 recruiters with the same skill set and get two wildly different results from them. You would think the results would be similar to each other. It was frustrating...I suspected that something was up. If I could solve this puzzle, I could easily double my profits with the same number of resources, ad spend, and effort I am using now.  

I started searching for any study, report, or any bit of creditable information on what would cause such a difference in performance with two equally skilled recruiters. I read article after article clicking link after link in the articles for what seemed like weeks until I finally ended up finding a study by Harvard business review. I found a study on sales companies' response rates 
 

Our research shows that most companies are not responding nearly fast enough… our research indicates that many firms are too slow to follow up on these leads. We audited 2,241 U.S. companies…. 24% took more than 24 hours—and 23% of the companies never responded at all. The average response time…. was 42 hours.  
These results are especially shocking given how quickly online leads go cold. Firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times as likely to qualify the lead….as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later—and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer.”’ 
Source: Harvard Business Review 
https://timetoreply.com/harvard-business-review/ 
 
The first time I read the report, I thought it had valuable information. And I put the report in my file to read again. I continued my search, but I could not find anything that useful. A few weeks passed, and I picked up the Harvard business review report to read it again. When I finished reading the report, I came to a different conclusion. Have you ever experienced that? You get a different message from the same report or book on a different read. 

This time reading the report, I realized the variable for success was not the sales skill of the salesperson. The variable for success was the speed at which the salesperson responded to the lead. Only after the salesperson was talking to a prospect did the sales skill come into play. 

I wondered if that was happening with my recruitment team. It would explain the discrepancy between the two recruiters with similar skills. With these market conditions, candidates rule the hiring process. Who knows. First, I needed to know how fast we respond to new candidates. To do that, we had to pull reporting from our phone system. And reporting from our hire-up funnel software and cross reference that will the call report to get the full picture. We broke it down by each recruiter extension and transfer.  

Here is what we uncovered each recruiter handled their new candidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason on how my recruiters responded to the new canidates they received from our advertising.  As we studied the data, a pattern started to emerge. We cross-referenced that with the placements report, and my suspicions were confirmed.  

Some of our recruiters responded to new canidates on the day they applied and they filled a lot more jobs than the recruiters that responded the following day or the following two days. There was a direct correlation between how fast a call, text, or resume was responded to by a recruiter. And the total number of people hired by that recruiter. 

The Harvard Business Review Report proved to ring true in recruiting candidates from the Internet. This means we lost a lot of candidates, which cost a lot of money. And wasted a lot of our recruiter's time following up trying to get these canidates on the phone to qualify. All because we delayed responding to new canidates one day. Is your team doing the same thing?  

Section 1 Ghosting Canidates 

That reminded me of a project we did for a client. They were having all kinds of issues with their hiring. So we did a survey of all the candidates they did not hire, and the results were eye-opening 30% of the candidates said that the recruiter ghosted them. Almost half of the ghosted candidates said it happened more than two times.    
 
This damaged their employer's brand. And can have a negative effect on future candidates from applying. It is critical that candidate ghosting does not happen. And adequate and appropriate feedback given to job seekers. No matter what stage of the hiring process they are in.    
 
Reshaping recruitment and retention is all about human interaction. It is not just about AI or an online experience; it has a human element. So, you must integrate human interaction with technology and AI to achieve the greatest results, hybrid AI. I worked with the team to determine the best way to respond to new candidates from our advertising. After weeks of trial and error. We tested different timelines on hundreds of new candidates from our advertising.   
 
AI crunched the data and showed that if we returned our candidates' first call. Text, application or resume within 15 minutes. We were six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. The team agreed that 15 minutes was a reasonable time to respond. So that became the new business rule.    
 
Section 2 Check & Balance:  

After that experience, I realized I needed a check and balance system. To ensure that my recruiters were treating each and every candidate the same. And the system informs the management team when business processes are not being followed. Or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure you do not miss a hiring deadline. To carry out this. We use check and balance rules in the workflow that could not be possible without automation with decision logic.    
 
Having check and balance rules in Hire up Funnels was an eye-opening experience for me. Before we put our check and balance in the workflow. We had no way to measure how our recruitment team followed up with canidates. Just like most of you.    
 
I did not know how long it took our recruiters to respond to new candidates from our advertising. Or if they were getting ghosted, It was like flying blind. With our check and balance rules. You will know if all your business’s best practices and recruitment rules are followed. Ensuring recruiter efficacy and good candidate experience. like flying with instruments, you know if you are on course or not, so you can correct and get back on track.    
 
Here is how the check and balance rules work. If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. Call a candidate back within 15 min of receiving a new candidate. The check and balance workflow would send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task and e-mail. Ensure a prompt callback and make sure the new candidate is not ghosted.    
 
Suppose this happens two times in a row. And the candidate is not called within the time limit of our business rules. In that case, the workflow sends a notification to the assigned recruitment manager. Who can then figure out why the new candidate. That you spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules. For the highest advertising-to-interview conversion ratio.    
 
Ensuring all candidates get a great experience. You are more productive; you hire more of the qualified candidates you are already talking to. The Hire Up funnels workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate. So, you hire more of the qualified canidates you are already talking to. Never worry if your team is not following best practices and rules. Our check and balance rules will keep you informed.   

After giving our team the information and tools to improve their results. Our team now has an average 5-minute response time to new candidates from our advertising. All recruiters have increased the number of hires. Some so much that you would not believe me if I shared them with you. Check and balance rules can carry out various tasks. We use several versions throughout our Hire Up Funnels.   
 
Section 3 Follow up programmed in check and balance rules.    
 
I wanted to beat the big company for the most placements badly. I dug a little deeper in the data and started to see a new pattern. I shared it with the team, and they confirmed it. When a candidate calls, text, or submit a resume. And if the call went to voicemail or a text was not returned, that started a domino effect of complications. The most time-consuming was the never-ending game of phone tag. To get the candidate back on the phone or respond to your text so you could activate. And start the recruitment process of qualification.    
 
I returned to my Hire up Funnels software and pulled reporting of follow-up attempts. To successful calls where we got the candidate on the phone to do the prescreening call to qualify. And move to the next stage of the recruitment cycle success path. 
 
The results were like the new candidate from advertising results. Every recruiter handled the new canidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason for how many follow-up calls a recruiter made. Everyone on the team had a different number of follow-up calls. We shared the results with the team. The high-performing recruiters made more follow-up calls than the low-performer ones. The report told us that 20% of the team gave up after only two follow-up attempts. That was disappointing...   
 
I shared the results with the team to see the best way to fix this. The recruiters that responded with the least number of follow-up calls. Shared some very valuable information with us. The main reason for not making as many follow-up calls. Was that they felt like they were pestering the candidates. And felt like they were being pushy. I can understand that.    
 
So, the big question was. How many times should candidates be called for the best contact, qualification, and hiring ratios? And so, your team knows the number of calls to make that they are not bothering candidates. So, we tested the candidates we had. To see the correct number of follow-ups. To get a candidate that responded to our job advertisement. On the phone who did not answer the recruiters' first return call.   
 
We tested calling, texting, and sending e-mails, and pixel targeting. It was surprising to learn that you must do much more follow-up than one would think for a job.  But you do not want to overdo it, burn out your candidates, and destroy your reputation in your market. The sweet spot is to be persistent but not a stalker. The stats told us that we needed to follow up seven. To eight times to get a candidate activated on the phone (without upsetting them). To do a prescreen call and qualify.    
 
Digging even deeper into the data. We also discovered that if we did not get the candidate on the phone in the first seven days after applying with us. They went cold and non-responsive. The tests we ran told us we got more people on the phone to prescreen. And qualify if we used a combination of phone calls and text messages, and e-mails.    
 
On a fluke my lead recruiter suggested that we try using our AI chatbot in our follow-up messages. To give our canidates the option to use the AI chatbot to book time to talk to the recruiter, and boy, did they.   
 
Section 4 Follow-up rules.    
 
We added follow-up rules to our check and balance workflow with that data. When the recruiter calls the new candidate back, the call is unanswered. We have a control requiring eight follow-ups for every new candidate not activated. The recruiter calls the candidate every other day for eight days. When the recruiter does not call. We set up the workflow to send our omnichannel communication.    
 
This way, we reach out to our candidate eight times in six days. With four calls from the recruiter and four automated Omni channel communication. Including AI chatbots, to schedule a call with a recruiter. Increasing the efficiency of our recruitment team. Getting more people on the phone. And into the qualification stage of the recruitment cycle.    
 
If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. The workflow would automatically send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task in their calendar and e-mail. If your recruiter does not adhere to the follow-up rules. Another reminder task is sent if this happens twice in a row. The candidate is not called within the time frame of our business rules. Then the workflow sends a notification. To the assigned recruitment manager. Who can figure out why the new candidate. That we spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules time frame.    
 
 
Ensure all candidates have a great recruitment experience. And we are more productive, so we hire more of the qualified candidates we are already talking to. The recruitment funnel workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate.  
 
Section 5 Conclusion 
 
Here is how important a good candidate's experience is. According to career plug. 80% of candidates said that a positive candidate experience influenced their decision to say yes to an offer. 58% of job seekers said that a poor candidate experience led them to decline a job.    
https://www.careerplug.com/blog/improve-hiring-with-better-communication/  
 
So, I adjusted my funnel with the check and balance rules of 15 min to return a call. And programed eight follow ups for every new candidate and relaunched it. Did some optimization and the team started to hire more people. We started to beat the big company for placements. With the same resources I was spending before I made the changes to the check and balance rules. It was an all-out war for the top spot. One week they would take the top spot, and the next week, we would take the top spot. This went on for several weeks, the competition was fierce. It was technology strategy versus strength, who would win?    
 
With a dedicated team and the right tools. We were able to track, measure and optimize our recruitment funnels. To become number one, we held the top spot to the end of the recruitment contract. Technology strategy wins over strength every time...    
 
Success is achieved by adjusting technology. To accommodate human behavior opened a whole new world for me. What else can I do to gain market advantage? So, I studied the biggest technology companies. To figure out how they grew so fast and became market leaders.   
 
Remember, there is something much bigger at play here than just data. As the data increases and the metrics become more trackable, It is easy to get sucked into the analytics of it all. And in the process, forget that there is a person on the other side of the metrics. A person with a problem, a person who needs you to solve their problem.

Candidates deserve respect and communication. A small act of kindness can brighten their job search. Prioritize empathy and make a positive impact together! 💙 #StopGhosting #HiringWithHeart,Chapter 3 Speed is what matters.,"I remember like it yesterday. I had landed a giant recruitment contract. But I did not know I was not the only recruitment company with the contract. They also contracted with one of my biggest competitors. 
The big company had more people and more resources, and they were using them to beat me out for all the placements. I was in the fight of my business life. They did not like me being there and were determined to push me out. I needed to make placements, or I would lose the contract, and the big company would win. 

So I decided I would use the shotgun approach. I upped my advertising budget again and did a text message campaign for the candidates that were on my list (candidates I own). It kind of worked, and kind of didn’t work... here is what I mean. The number of candidates that responded to our job posting & text message campaign increased.   

But the number of people we hired only increased for some recruiters and not others. The strange thing I noticed about the results is. I would have 2 recruiters with the same skill set and get two wildly different results from them. You would think the results would be similar to each other. It was frustrating...I suspected that something was up. If I could solve this puzzle, I could easily double my profits with the same number of resources, ad spend, and effort I am using now.  

I started searching for any study, report, or any bit of creditable information on what would cause such a difference in performance with two equally skilled recruiters. I read article after article clicking link after link in the articles for what seemed like weeks until I finally ended up finding a study by Harvard business review. I found a study on sales companies' response rates 
 

Our research shows that most companies are not responding nearly fast enough… our research indicates that many firms are too slow to follow up on these leads. We audited 2,241 U.S. companies…. 24% took more than 24 hours—and 23% of the companies never responded at all. The average response time…. was 42 hours.  
These results are especially shocking given how quickly online leads go cold. Firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times as likely to qualify the lead….as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later—and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer.”’ 
Source: Harvard Business Review 
https://timetoreply.com/harvard-business-review/ 
 
The first time I read the report, I thought it had valuable information. And I put the report in my file to read again. I continued my search, but I could not find anything that useful. A few weeks passed, and I picked up the Harvard business review report to read it again. When I finished reading the report, I came to a different conclusion. Have you ever experienced that? You get a different message from the same report or book on a different read. 

This time reading the report, I realized the variable for success was not the sales skill of the salesperson. The variable for success was the speed at which the salesperson responded to the lead. Only after the salesperson was talking to a prospect did the sales skill come into play. 

I wondered if that was happening with my recruitment team. It would explain the discrepancy between the two recruiters with similar skills. With these market conditions, candidates rule the hiring process. Who knows. First, I needed to know how fast we respond to new candidates. To do that, we had to pull reporting from our phone system. And reporting from our hire-up funnel software and cross reference that will the call report to get the full picture. We broke it down by each recruiter extension and transfer.  

Here is what we uncovered each recruiter handled their new candidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason on how my recruiters responded to the new canidates they received from our advertising.  As we studied the data, a pattern started to emerge. We cross-referenced that with the placements report, and my suspicions were confirmed.  

Some of our recruiters responded to new canidates on the day they applied and they filled a lot more jobs than the recruiters that responded the following day or the following two days. There was a direct correlation between how fast a call, text, or resume was responded to by a recruiter. And the total number of people hired by that recruiter. 

The Harvard Business Review Report proved to ring true in recruiting candidates from the Internet. This means we lost a lot of candidates, which cost a lot of money. And wasted a lot of our recruiter's time following up trying to get these canidates on the phone to qualify. All because we delayed responding to new canidates one day. Is your team doing the same thing?  

Section 1 Ghosting Canidates 

That reminded me of a project we did for a client. They were having all kinds of issues with their hiring. So we did a survey of all the candidates they did not hire, and the results were eye-opening 30% of the candidates said that the recruiter ghosted them. Almost half of the ghosted candidates said it happened more than two times.    
 
This damaged their employer's brand. And can have a negative effect on future candidates from applying. It is critical that candidate ghosting does not happen. And adequate and appropriate feedback given to job seekers. No matter what stage of the hiring process they are in.    
 
Reshaping recruitment and retention is all about human interaction. It is not just about AI or an online experience; it has a human element. So, you must integrate human interaction with technology and AI to achieve the greatest results, hybrid AI. I worked with the team to determine the best way to respond to new candidates from our advertising. After weeks of trial and error. We tested different timelines on hundreds of new candidates from our advertising.   
 
AI crunched the data and showed that if we returned our candidates' first call. Text, application or resume within 15 minutes. We were six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. The team agreed that 15 minutes was a reasonable time to respond. So that became the new business rule.    
 
Section 2 Check & Balance:  

After that experience, I realized I needed a check and balance system. To ensure that my recruiters were treating each and every candidate the same. And the system informs the management team when business processes are not being followed. Or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure you do not miss a hiring deadline. To carry out this. We use check and balance rules in the workflow that could not be possible without automation with decision logic.    
 
Having check and balance rules in Hire up Funnels was an eye-opening experience for me. Before we put our check and balance in the workflow. We had no way to measure how our recruitment team followed up with canidates. Just like most of you.    
 
I did not know how long it took our recruiters to respond to new candidates from our advertising. Or if they were getting ghosted, It was like flying blind. With our check and balance rules. You will know if all your business’s best practices and recruitment rules are followed. Ensuring recruiter efficacy and good candidate experience. like flying with instruments, you know if you are on course or not, so you can correct and get back on track.    
 
Here is how the check and balance rules work. If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. Call a candidate back within 15 min of receiving a new candidate. The check and balance workflow would send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task and e-mail. Ensure a prompt callback and make sure the new candidate is not ghosted.    
 
Suppose this happens two times in a row. And the candidate is not called within the time limit of our business rules. In that case, the workflow sends a notification to the assigned recruitment manager. Who can then figure out why the new candidate. That you spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules. For the highest advertising-to-interview conversion ratio.    
 
Ensuring all candidates get a great experience. You are more productive; you hire more of the qualified candidates you are already talking to. The Hire Up funnels workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate. So, you hire more of the qualified canidates you are already talking to. Never worry if your team is not following best practices and rules. Our check and balance rules will keep you informed.   

After giving our team the information and tools to improve their results. Our team now has an average 5-minute response time to new candidates from our advertising. All recruiters have increased the number of hires. Some so much that you would not believe me if I shared them with you. Check and balance rules can carry out various tasks. We use several versions throughout our Hire Up Funnels.   
 
Section 3 Follow up programmed in check and balance rules.    
 
I wanted to beat the big company for the most placements badly. I dug a little deeper in the data and started to see a new pattern. I shared it with the team, and they confirmed it. When a candidate calls, text, or submit a resume. And if the call went to voicemail or a text was not returned, that started a domino effect of complications. The most time-consuming was the never-ending game of phone tag. To get the candidate back on the phone or respond to your text so you could activate. And start the recruitment process of qualification.    
 
I returned to my Hire up Funnels software and pulled reporting of follow-up attempts. To successful calls where we got the candidate on the phone to do the prescreening call to qualify. And move to the next stage of the recruitment cycle success path. 
 
The results were like the new candidate from advertising results. Every recruiter handled the new canidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason for how many follow-up calls a recruiter made. Everyone on the team had a different number of follow-up calls. We shared the results with the team. The high-performing recruiters made more follow-up calls than the low-performer ones. The report told us that 20% of the team gave up after only two follow-up attempts. That was disappointing...   
 
I shared the results with the team to see the best way to fix this. The recruiters that responded with the least number of follow-up calls. Shared some very valuable information with us. The main reason for not making as many follow-up calls. Was that they felt like they were pestering the candidates. And felt like they were being pushy. I can understand that.    
 
So, the big question was. How many times should candidates be called for the best contact, qualification, and hiring ratios? And so, your team knows the number of calls to make that they are not bothering candidates. So, we tested the candidates we had. To see the correct number of follow-ups. To get a candidate that responded to our job advertisement. On the phone who did not answer the recruiters' first return call.   
 
We tested calling, texting, and sending e-mails, and pixel targeting. It was surprising to learn that you must do much more follow-up than one would think for a job.  But you do not want to overdo it, burn out your candidates, and destroy your reputation in your market. The sweet spot is to be persistent but not a stalker. The stats told us that we needed to follow up seven. To eight times to get a candidate activated on the phone (without upsetting them). To do a prescreen call and qualify.    
 
Digging even deeper into the data. We also discovered that if we did not get the candidate on the phone in the first seven days after applying with us. They went cold and non-responsive. The tests we ran told us we got more people on the phone to prescreen. And qualify if we used a combination of phone calls and text messages, and e-mails.    
 
On a fluke my lead recruiter suggested that we try using our AI chatbot in our follow-up messages. To give our canidates the option to use the AI chatbot to book time to talk to the recruiter, and boy, did they.   
 
Section 4 Follow-up rules.    
 
We added follow-up rules to our check and balance workflow with that data. When the recruiter calls the new candidate back, the call is unanswered. We have a control requiring eight follow-ups for every new candidate not activated. The recruiter calls the candidate every other day for eight days. When the recruiter does not call. We set up the workflow to send our omnichannel communication.    
 
This way, we reach out to our candidate eight times in six days. With four calls from the recruiter and four automated Omni channel communication. Including AI chatbots, to schedule a call with a recruiter. Increasing the efficiency of our recruitment team. Getting more people on the phone. And into the qualification stage of the recruitment cycle.    
 
If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. The workflow would automatically send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task in their calendar and e-mail. If your recruiter does not adhere to the follow-up rules. Another reminder task is sent if this happens twice in a row. The candidate is not called within the time frame of our business rules. Then the workflow sends a notification. To the assigned recruitment manager. Who can figure out why the new candidate. That we spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules time frame.    
 
 
Ensure all candidates have a great recruitment experience. And we are more productive, so we hire more of the qualified candidates we are already talking to. The recruitment funnel workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate.  
 
Section 5 Conclusion 
 
Here is how important a good candidate's experience is. According to career plug. 80% of candidates said that a positive candidate experience influenced their decision to say yes to an offer. 58% of job seekers said that a poor candidate experience led them to decline a job.    
https://www.careerplug.com/blog/improve-hiring-with-better-communication/  
 
So, I adjusted my funnel with the check and balance rules of 15 min to return a call. And programed eight follow ups for every new candidate and relaunched it. Did some optimization and the team started to hire more people. We started to beat the big company for placements. With the same resources I was spending before I made the changes to the check and balance rules. It was an all-out war for the top spot. One week they would take the top spot, and the next week, we would take the top spot. This went on for several weeks, the competition was fierce. It was technology strategy versus strength, who would win?    
 
With a dedicated team and the right tools. We were able to track, measure and optimize our recruitment funnels. To become number one, we held the top spot to the end of the recruitment contract. Technology strategy wins over strength every time...    
 
Success is achieved by adjusting technology. To accommodate human behavior opened a whole new world for me. What else can I do to gain market advantage? So, I studied the biggest technology companies. To figure out how they grew so fast and became market leaders.   
 
Remember, there is something much bigger at play here than just data. As the data increases and the metrics become more trackable, It is easy to get sucked into the analytics of it all. And in the process, forget that there is a person on the other side of the metrics. A person with a problem, a person who needs you to solve their problem.

Use AI and automation to transform hiring strategies and boost success rates. Embrace digital transformation now! 🚀🤖,Chapter 1: Navigating the Hiring Highway,"
Over two decades ago, when I first entered the fascinating world of trucking and logistics recruitment, it was a different era. Hiring was a straightforward process back then, perhaps even rudimentary compared to today's standards. The industry was growing, and jobs were plentiful. Looking back, those were the days of simplicity in the hiring landscape.
But as the adage goes, ""Change is the only constant."" The tides of time swirled, and so did the logistics and trucking industry. The big problem was the driver shortage, a persistent thorn in the side of an industry otherwise buzzing with opportunity. It felt like being stranded on a highway with a truck full of promises but no drivers to steer it.
I struggled with this relentless challenge, tirelessly brainstorming strategies to attract and retain the drivers we hired. At times, it seemed like an impossible task. But I wasn't alone. The entire industry was facing the same predicament. We just started the AI revolution, and industries worldwide were turning to technology as their savior. Intrigued and inspired, I contemplated if AI could be our knight in shining armor.
The world event that revolutionized hiring was the adoption of Chat GPT. AI and automation in recruitment and retention processes. It happened slowly at first, but its impact was profound. Companies using AI and automation were beating out companies not using AI and automation. Companies started using AI-powered recruitment systems to automate recruitment workflows and automate communication through omnichannel. They even had ways to inform you how fast your recruitment team returned canidates calls and texts, ensuring the best canidates to application ratio. And no canidates get ghosted, providing a great candidate experience. So more of your qualified candidates make it to your job offer. Giving your team the canidates needed to make the best job-to-candidate match. 
From the shadows of this transformation emerged a glimmer of hope. Could we, too, harness the power of technology to tackle our recruitment woes? The promise was enticing, and the opportunity immense.
In this chapter, we'll traverse the hiring highway, shedding light on traditional hiring methods and exploring the role of technology in modern hiring processes. We'll delve into my personal journey and how my perspective on hiring has evolved. Drawing inspiration from the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" and the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" we'll learn to identify talent and overcome adversity. Buckle up, for an enlightening ride awaits us on the hiring highway.
Section 1 - Analysis of traditional hiring methods in the trucking industry
Steering back to the beginning of my career, hiring in the trucking industry was an art rooted in gut feelings, intuition, and personal judgment. Candidates were assessed primarily based on their ability to handle a truck, commitment to the job, and willingness to spend long hours on the road. They were face-to-face interactions, handshake deals, and decisions made around the coffee table. It was all incredibly human and intensely personal.
The process took time and often hit-or-miss. While we celebrated when we found the right fit, it was back to square one when we didn't. It was incredibly challenging to assess a candidate's commitment, adaptability, and resilience through just an interview or two. Our assessment was based largely on their past driving record and the charm of their personality.
Furthermore, the hiring process was localized. We predominantly relied on local talent pools or word-of-mouth referrals. Our go-to recruitment strategy was placing a help wanted ad in the local newspaper or at the town job fair to fill jobs. In some ways, it was comforting, familiar. But it was also limiting.
This traditional approach began showing its cracks as the industry grew more competitive. Trucking is about more than just driving from point A to point B. It's about adhering to tight schedules, maintaining the vehicle, managing on-road challenges, and ensuring the safe and timely delivery of goods while being a customer service rep. And most importantly, it's about doing all this consistently, day in and day out, while providing a great customer experience. 
These complexities were often overlooked in traditional hiring practices. As a result, we ended up hiring drivers who were good at driving but needed help with the other aspects of the job. The result? High turnover rates and a constant struggle to keep our complete fleet on the road.
As I navigated these challenges, I saw the need for a more robust, comprehensive hiring strategy that considered a candidate’s driving skills and overall suitability for the job. The seeds of change were sown. But what I needed was a game changer, a revolutionary approach that would take our hiring strategy from basic to brilliant.
Section 2 - The Role of Technology in modern hiring processes
The AI (artificial intelligence) Technology revolution began to assert its role in the modern hiring process during this quest for a new approach. Inspired by industries that were seamlessly integrating AI and automation in their hiring practices, I pondered upon its potential in ours.
As we dove deeper into the realm of technology, we discovered a world brimming with possibilities. Candidate Relation Management Systems (CRM) Built on advanced automation platforms. Equipped with AI capabilities were revolutionizing the way hiring was done. 
The sophisticated system had four different advanced automation systems running in the background. To provide your team with the right tools and system to streamline the recruitment processes. It promised recruiter efficiency, accuracy, and a significant reduction in time-to-hire by providing a great candidate experience. 
Moreover, data-driven hiring became a possibility. We could analyze historical data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. AI brought the power of predictive analytics, enabling us to foresee hiring trends, anticipate needs, and strategize accordingly. We could answer critical questions like: What traits do our best drivers share? What makes a driver stay with us for the long term?
Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual reality tools opened avenues for a more engaging candidate experience. Prospective drivers could interact with chatbots to get immediate answers to their queries. Virtual reality could give them a realistic simulation of their job, leading to better-informed decisions.
The role of technology in modern hiring processes extends beyond just finding and hiring the right candidate. It also played a significant part in onboarding and retaining the hired talent. Technology made keeping the drivers engaged and committed easier, from AI-assisted onboarding programs to regular check-ins and feedback loops.
Looking at all these possibilities, I was in awe of how technology could be a game changer. It had the potential to address the very issues we had been struggling with. It was a revolutionary, data-driven, and efficient approach to an age-old problem. As I stood on the brink of this technological revolution, I was convinced that this was the path we needed to tread.
Section 3 - My journey and the evolution of my perspective on hiring
In my journey from just a recruiter to being the top Digital Recruitment and Retention Strategies for the trucking and logistics industry.  I've weathered numerous storms and celebrated countless victories. Each phase offered a learning experience and substantially altered my perspective on hiring.
I started my career when hiring was primarily a personal affair. Hiring is based on a face-to-face interview and a person’s willingness to work hard. It was the age of intuition-based hiring. That's not to say it was flawed - I was a testament to its success. But as I moved up the ladder, I realized it was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.
I remember distinctly, a time in the early stages of my recruitment career when we were struggling with high turnover. We had a team of hard-working drivers, but they weren't staying. The strain of long hours, tight schedules, and road challenges was taking its toll. This was my first brush with the limitations of traditional hiring methods.
I realized then that hiring for the trucking industry needed more than just intuition - it required understanding the complexities of the job and assessing the candidate's capability to handle them. It was about hiring drivers who wouldn't just drive but thrive in the high-pressure, challenging trucking environment of today.
As I wrestled with these challenges, I discovered the potential of technology to transform our hiring process. What initially seemed like a daunting, almost alien concept started making sense. The more I delved into it, the more I saw its potential to streamline our hiring, expand our reach, and drastically improve our success rate.
My journey through the adoption of AI in hiring echoed the broader AI revolution that was transforming industries worldwide. It was a period of rapid evolution and change. Companies that embraced AI and advanced automation were propelling ahead, while those that resisted were falling behind.
In this whirlwind of change, I found inspiration in the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. They advocated a data-driven, structured approach to hiring - a methodology that could potentially revolutionize our hiring process. I also found motivation in the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". The protagonist's resilience, commitment, and relentless pursuit of his dream was a reflection of the kind of drivers we wanted to hire. I was able to harness the power of AI by following the lead from wall street quants. The dynamic world of Wall Street, known for its rapid fortunes made or lost, has seen the game completely changed with the introduction of AI and Quants. 
These influences shaped my perspective, leading me to understand that the key to successful hiring lay in a harmonious blend of technology and human touch. Humanity was becoming the new technology. I realized that while AI and automation could do much of the heavy lifting, the human element was critical in making the final call. After all, it was about finding people who would be the face of our company on the road. 
Section 4 - Learning from the reference book and movie, with a focus on identifying talent and overcoming adversity
I found valuable lessons in ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. The book gave me the tools to chart a course in the tumultuous seas of hiring, particularly as it focused on hiring for attitude and potential. They emphasized how it's not always about the qualifications or experience; it's about who they are as individuals and whether they align with the company's values and culture.
Their concept of the A player - an employee that has at least a 90 percent chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10 percent of possible candidates could achieve - resonated deeply. The A player for us was a driver who not only drove but also represented our company's values, was the face of our company, maintained strong customer relationships, and upheld the highest safety standards.
However, finding these A players required a change in our hiring approach. We needed to look beyond just the driving skills and delve deeper into their attitude, resilience, and potential. We needed a structured, data-driven approach that combined technology and human intuition - the perfect blend of artificial and emotional intelligence. 
This reminded me of how AI gave Wall Street Firms an edge over the competition. However, when AI became widely adopted, this advantage faded. This is where Quants, the heroes of wall street, stepped in. They brought forth a revolutionary approach, Hybrid AI. Where we use the best of human intelligence paired with artificial intelligence. The firms that adopted this approach by the Quants pulled ahead of the competition, redefining the leaders on wall street. 
Wall streets evolution parallels the current state of recruitment and retention. As quants disrupted Wall Street with Hybrid AI, recruitment and retention strategist are becoming the “quants” of HR. We are using Hybrid AI to improve recruitment and retention in the trucking and logistics industry. Where humans make the final decision aided by the data from AI. 
This is where the lessons from the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" came into play. The protagonist, Chris Gardner, was the embodiment of resilience and determination. He was a man with limited resources and opportunities, yet his unyielding determination to provide for his son and pursue his dream job was inspiring.
Gardner was a perfect example of an A player. He didn't have the qualifications or experience, but his attitude and resilience were unmatched. He was the kind of driver we wanted - one who would persist through challenges, remain committed to the job, and continuously strive for excellence.
The movie was a stark reminder that adversities can be overcome with a resilient spirit and a relentless pursuit of happiness. It was a reflection of the challenges our drivers faced - long hours, road hazards, solitude - and yet, with the right attitude and support, they could overcome them.
Bringing these lessons into our hiring process, we reshaped our strategy. We deployed AI tools to screen for skill-based parameters, freeing us to focus on personal traits during interviews. We looked for traits like resilience, determination, and a positive attitude, traits that we had overlooked in our traditional hiring approach.
We started conducting behavioral interviews, posing situational questions to assess how they would react in challenging scenarios. How did they handle a particularly challenging delivery? How did they cope with the solitude on long hauls? How did they deal with difficult customers or situations?
We began to see a change as we integrated these lessons into our hiring process. Our hiring decisions were becoming more informed, our driver pool was strengthening, and our retention rates were improving. We were making headway in our battle with the driver shortage.
Section 5 - Conclusion: Navigating the Road Ahead
The transformation in our recruitment approach was not an overnight occurrence; it was a journey paved with trials, errors, and learnings. However, these changes were essential and long overdue, not just for our company but for the trucking industry as a whole.
The lessons we learned, the improvements we made, and the progress we witnessed were encouraging. We managed to turn the wheels of our recruitment process, steering it away from traditional, limiting hiring practices towards a future defined by innovation, inclusivity, and intelligence. We succeeded in integrating the nuances of our industry, the essence of our drivers, and the power of technology into our hiring process.
Yet, as with any journey, ours is ongoing, and we continue to learn, adapt, and evolve. We are by no means perfect, and the driver shortage problem is far from resolved. But we are better than the competition, and that's what matters.
The AI revolution is reshaping recruitment and retention in the trucking industry, and its adoption is not a matter of” if” but “when.” The driver shortage is a pressing issue that warrants immediate attention and creative solutions. Advanced technology, AI, and automation present themselves as powerful allies in this fight. If you can connect the dots of strategy to use AI and advanced automation for you. 
The integration of technology in our hiring process has offered us insights, solutions, and opportunities we could not have imagined. It has allowed us to explore a wealth of untapped potential and resources that can prove to be game-changers in our industry.
However, technology is only a tool; its successful implementation and impact depend heavily on the user. A hammer in the hands of a child is merely a toy, but in the hands of a sculptor, it can create masterpieces. Similarly, AI and automation can transform the recruitment landscape in our industry, but only if used strategically and wisely.
And in this endeavor, empathy and understanding are our guiding lights. It's about remembering that behind every application and resume is a person with hopes, dreams, fears, and responsibilities. It's about knowing that a driver is not just a worker, but an ambassador of our company, a custodian of our goods, and a crucial link in our economic chain.
I implore other industry leaders, HR professionals, and transport managers to embrace this new dawn, challenge traditional norms, and navigate uncharted territories. The road ahead is uncertain, filled with challenges and opportunities alike. But if we navigate it together, sharing insights, learnings, and best practices, we can shape a future where driver shortages are a thing of the past, and the industry thrives with committed, competent, and content drivers.
Let this chapter serve as an invitation to embark on this transformative journey where technology meets talent acquisition. Remember, it's not about merely surviving the driver shortage but thriving through it.
Action Steps:
1.	Challenge the Norms: Question your existing recruitment practices. Are they effective? Are they limiting your pool of potential drivers?
2.	Adopt Technology: Embrace the use of AI and automation in your hiring process. Use them to streamline processes, broaden your search, and facilitate better decision-making.
3.	Focus on the Person, Not Just the Driver: Look beyond driving skills and qualifications. Assess attitudes, values, and potential. Remember, you're hiring a person, not just a driver.
4.	Learn and Adapt: Stay updated with industry trends, technological advancements, and best practices. Learn from others and be willing to adapt your processes accordingly.
5.	Share Your Insights: Don't keep your learnings to yourself. Share them with others in the industry. Remember, we're in this together.

Heraclitus teaches us that change is inevitable. Adapt and accept to thrive. Let this quote inspire resilience and grace in navigating life's twists. #EmbraceChange #HeraclitusWisdom,Chapter 1: Navigating the Hiring Highway,"
Over two decades ago, when I first entered the fascinating world of trucking and logistics recruitment, it was a different era. Hiring was a straightforward process back then, perhaps even rudimentary compared to today's standards. The industry was growing, and jobs were plentiful. Looking back, those were the days of simplicity in the hiring landscape.
But as the adage goes, ""Change is the only constant."" The tides of time swirled, and so did the logistics and trucking industry. The big problem was the driver shortage, a persistent thorn in the side of an industry otherwise buzzing with opportunity. It felt like being stranded on a highway with a truck full of promises but no drivers to steer it.
I struggled with this relentless challenge, tirelessly brainstorming strategies to attract and retain the drivers we hired. At times, it seemed like an impossible task. But I wasn't alone. The entire industry was facing the same predicament. We just started the AI revolution, and industries worldwide were turning to technology as their savior. Intrigued and inspired, I contemplated if AI could be our knight in shining armor.
The world event that revolutionized hiring was the adoption of Chat GPT. AI and automation in recruitment and retention processes. It happened slowly at first, but its impact was profound. Companies using AI and automation were beating out companies not using AI and automation. Companies started using AI-powered recruitment systems to automate recruitment workflows and automate communication through omnichannel. They even had ways to inform you how fast your recruitment team returned canidates calls and texts, ensuring the best canidates to application ratio. And no canidates get ghosted, providing a great candidate experience. So more of your qualified candidates make it to your job offer. Giving your team the canidates needed to make the best job-to-candidate match. 
From the shadows of this transformation emerged a glimmer of hope. Could we, too, harness the power of technology to tackle our recruitment woes? The promise was enticing, and the opportunity immense.
In this chapter, we'll traverse the hiring highway, shedding light on traditional hiring methods and exploring the role of technology in modern hiring processes. We'll delve into my personal journey and how my perspective on hiring has evolved. Drawing inspiration from the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" and the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" we'll learn to identify talent and overcome adversity. Buckle up, for an enlightening ride awaits us on the hiring highway.
Section 1 - Analysis of traditional hiring methods in the trucking industry
Steering back to the beginning of my career, hiring in the trucking industry was an art rooted in gut feelings, intuition, and personal judgment. Candidates were assessed primarily based on their ability to handle a truck, commitment to the job, and willingness to spend long hours on the road. They were face-to-face interactions, handshake deals, and decisions made around the coffee table. It was all incredibly human and intensely personal.
The process took time and often hit-or-miss. While we celebrated when we found the right fit, it was back to square one when we didn't. It was incredibly challenging to assess a candidate's commitment, adaptability, and resilience through just an interview or two. Our assessment was based largely on their past driving record and the charm of their personality.
Furthermore, the hiring process was localized. We predominantly relied on local talent pools or word-of-mouth referrals. Our go-to recruitment strategy was placing a help wanted ad in the local newspaper or at the town job fair to fill jobs. In some ways, it was comforting, familiar. But it was also limiting.
This traditional approach began showing its cracks as the industry grew more competitive. Trucking is about more than just driving from point A to point B. It's about adhering to tight schedules, maintaining the vehicle, managing on-road challenges, and ensuring the safe and timely delivery of goods while being a customer service rep. And most importantly, it's about doing all this consistently, day in and day out, while providing a great customer experience. 
These complexities were often overlooked in traditional hiring practices. As a result, we ended up hiring drivers who were good at driving but needed help with the other aspects of the job. The result? High turnover rates and a constant struggle to keep our complete fleet on the road.
As I navigated these challenges, I saw the need for a more robust, comprehensive hiring strategy that considered a candidate’s driving skills and overall suitability for the job. The seeds of change were sown. But what I needed was a game changer, a revolutionary approach that would take our hiring strategy from basic to brilliant.
Section 2 - The Role of Technology in modern hiring processes
The AI (artificial intelligence) Technology revolution began to assert its role in the modern hiring process during this quest for a new approach. Inspired by industries that were seamlessly integrating AI and automation in their hiring practices, I pondered upon its potential in ours.
As we dove deeper into the realm of technology, we discovered a world brimming with possibilities. Candidate Relation Management Systems (CRM) Built on advanced automation platforms. Equipped with AI capabilities were revolutionizing the way hiring was done. 
The sophisticated system had four different advanced automation systems running in the background. To provide your team with the right tools and system to streamline the recruitment processes. It promised recruiter efficiency, accuracy, and a significant reduction in time-to-hire by providing a great candidate experience. 
Moreover, data-driven hiring became a possibility. We could analyze historical data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. AI brought the power of predictive analytics, enabling us to foresee hiring trends, anticipate needs, and strategize accordingly. We could answer critical questions like: What traits do our best drivers share? What makes a driver stay with us for the long term?
Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual reality tools opened avenues for a more engaging candidate experience. Prospective drivers could interact with chatbots to get immediate answers to their queries. Virtual reality could give them a realistic simulation of their job, leading to better-informed decisions.
The role of technology in modern hiring processes extends beyond just finding and hiring the right candidate. It also played a significant part in onboarding and retaining the hired talent. Technology made keeping the drivers engaged and committed easier, from AI-assisted onboarding programs to regular check-ins and feedback loops.
Looking at all these possibilities, I was in awe of how technology could be a game changer. It had the potential to address the very issues we had been struggling with. It was a revolutionary, data-driven, and efficient approach to an age-old problem. As I stood on the brink of this technological revolution, I was convinced that this was the path we needed to tread.
Section 3 - My journey and the evolution of my perspective on hiring
In my journey from just a recruiter to being the top Digital Recruitment and Retention Strategies for the trucking and logistics industry.  I've weathered numerous storms and celebrated countless victories. Each phase offered a learning experience and substantially altered my perspective on hiring.
I started my career when hiring was primarily a personal affair. Hiring is based on a face-to-face interview and a person’s willingness to work hard. It was the age of intuition-based hiring. That's not to say it was flawed - I was a testament to its success. But as I moved up the ladder, I realized it was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.
I remember distinctly, a time in the early stages of my recruitment career when we were struggling with high turnover. We had a team of hard-working drivers, but they weren't staying. The strain of long hours, tight schedules, and road challenges was taking its toll. This was my first brush with the limitations of traditional hiring methods.
I realized then that hiring for the trucking industry needed more than just intuition - it required understanding the complexities of the job and assessing the candidate's capability to handle them. It was about hiring drivers who wouldn't just drive but thrive in the high-pressure, challenging trucking environment of today.
As I wrestled with these challenges, I discovered the potential of technology to transform our hiring process. What initially seemed like a daunting, almost alien concept started making sense. The more I delved into it, the more I saw its potential to streamline our hiring, expand our reach, and drastically improve our success rate.
My journey through the adoption of AI in hiring echoed the broader AI revolution that was transforming industries worldwide. It was a period of rapid evolution and change. Companies that embraced AI and advanced automation were propelling ahead, while those that resisted were falling behind.
In this whirlwind of change, I found inspiration in the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. They advocated a data-driven, structured approach to hiring - a methodology that could potentially revolutionize our hiring process. I also found motivation in the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". The protagonist's resilience, commitment, and relentless pursuit of his dream was a reflection of the kind of drivers we wanted to hire. I was able to harness the power of AI by following the lead from wall street quants. The dynamic world of Wall Street, known for its rapid fortunes made or lost, has seen the game completely changed with the introduction of AI and Quants. 
These influences shaped my perspective, leading me to understand that the key to successful hiring lay in a harmonious blend of technology and human touch. Humanity was becoming the new technology. I realized that while AI and automation could do much of the heavy lifting, the human element was critical in making the final call. After all, it was about finding people who would be the face of our company on the road. 
Section 4 - Learning from the reference book and movie, with a focus on identifying talent and overcoming adversity
I found valuable lessons in ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. The book gave me the tools to chart a course in the tumultuous seas of hiring, particularly as it focused on hiring for attitude and potential. They emphasized how it's not always about the qualifications or experience; it's about who they are as individuals and whether they align with the company's values and culture.
Their concept of the A player - an employee that has at least a 90 percent chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10 percent of possible candidates could achieve - resonated deeply. The A player for us was a driver who not only drove but also represented our company's values, was the face of our company, maintained strong customer relationships, and upheld the highest safety standards.
However, finding these A players required a change in our hiring approach. We needed to look beyond just the driving skills and delve deeper into their attitude, resilience, and potential. We needed a structured, data-driven approach that combined technology and human intuition - the perfect blend of artificial and emotional intelligence. 
This reminded me of how AI gave Wall Street Firms an edge over the competition. However, when AI became widely adopted, this advantage faded. This is where Quants, the heroes of wall street, stepped in. They brought forth a revolutionary approach, Hybrid AI. Where we use the best of human intelligence paired with artificial intelligence. The firms that adopted this approach by the Quants pulled ahead of the competition, redefining the leaders on wall street. 
Wall streets evolution parallels the current state of recruitment and retention. As quants disrupted Wall Street with Hybrid AI, recruitment and retention strategist are becoming the “quants” of HR. We are using Hybrid AI to improve recruitment and retention in the trucking and logistics industry. Where humans make the final decision aided by the data from AI. 
This is where the lessons from the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" came into play. The protagonist, Chris Gardner, was the embodiment of resilience and determination. He was a man with limited resources and opportunities, yet his unyielding determination to provide for his son and pursue his dream job was inspiring.
Gardner was a perfect example of an A player. He didn't have the qualifications or experience, but his attitude and resilience were unmatched. He was the kind of driver we wanted - one who would persist through challenges, remain committed to the job, and continuously strive for excellence.
The movie was a stark reminder that adversities can be overcome with a resilient spirit and a relentless pursuit of happiness. It was a reflection of the challenges our drivers faced - long hours, road hazards, solitude - and yet, with the right attitude and support, they could overcome them.
Bringing these lessons into our hiring process, we reshaped our strategy. We deployed AI tools to screen for skill-based parameters, freeing us to focus on personal traits during interviews. We looked for traits like resilience, determination, and a positive attitude, traits that we had overlooked in our traditional hiring approach.
We started conducting behavioral interviews, posing situational questions to assess how they would react in challenging scenarios. How did they handle a particularly challenging delivery? How did they cope with the solitude on long hauls? How did they deal with difficult customers or situations?
We began to see a change as we integrated these lessons into our hiring process. Our hiring decisions were becoming more informed, our driver pool was strengthening, and our retention rates were improving. We were making headway in our battle with the driver shortage.
Section 5 - Conclusion: Navigating the Road Ahead
The transformation in our recruitment approach was not an overnight occurrence; it was a journey paved with trials, errors, and learnings. However, these changes were essential and long overdue, not just for our company but for the trucking industry as a whole.
The lessons we learned, the improvements we made, and the progress we witnessed were encouraging. We managed to turn the wheels of our recruitment process, steering it away from traditional, limiting hiring practices towards a future defined by innovation, inclusivity, and intelligence. We succeeded in integrating the nuances of our industry, the essence of our drivers, and the power of technology into our hiring process.
Yet, as with any journey, ours is ongoing, and we continue to learn, adapt, and evolve. We are by no means perfect, and the driver shortage problem is far from resolved. But we are better than the competition, and that's what matters.
The AI revolution is reshaping recruitment and retention in the trucking industry, and its adoption is not a matter of” if” but “when.” The driver shortage is a pressing issue that warrants immediate attention and creative solutions. Advanced technology, AI, and automation present themselves as powerful allies in this fight. If you can connect the dots of strategy to use AI and advanced automation for you. 
The integration of technology in our hiring process has offered us insights, solutions, and opportunities we could not have imagined. It has allowed us to explore a wealth of untapped potential and resources that can prove to be game-changers in our industry.
However, technology is only a tool; its successful implementation and impact depend heavily on the user. A hammer in the hands of a child is merely a toy, but in the hands of a sculptor, it can create masterpieces. Similarly, AI and automation can transform the recruitment landscape in our industry, but only if used strategically and wisely.
And in this endeavor, empathy and understanding are our guiding lights. It's about remembering that behind every application and resume is a person with hopes, dreams, fears, and responsibilities. It's about knowing that a driver is not just a worker, but an ambassador of our company, a custodian of our goods, and a crucial link in our economic chain.
I implore other industry leaders, HR professionals, and transport managers to embrace this new dawn, challenge traditional norms, and navigate uncharted territories. The road ahead is uncertain, filled with challenges and opportunities alike. But if we navigate it together, sharing insights, learnings, and best practices, we can shape a future where driver shortages are a thing of the past, and the industry thrives with committed, competent, and content drivers.
Let this chapter serve as an invitation to embark on this transformative journey where technology meets talent acquisition. Remember, it's not about merely surviving the driver shortage but thriving through it.
Action Steps:
1.	Challenge the Norms: Question your existing recruitment practices. Are they effective? Are they limiting your pool of potential drivers?
2.	Adopt Technology: Embrace the use of AI and automation in your hiring process. Use them to streamline processes, broaden your search, and facilitate better decision-making.
3.	Focus on the Person, Not Just the Driver: Look beyond driving skills and qualifications. Assess attitudes, values, and potential. Remember, you're hiring a person, not just a driver.
4.	Learn and Adapt: Stay updated with industry trends, technological advancements, and best practices. Learn from others and be willing to adapt your processes accordingly.
5.	Share Your Insights: Don't keep your learnings to yourself. Share them with others in the industry. Remember, we're in this together.

The problem wasn't just about finding people with the appropriate driving skills and experience; it was about finding individuals who could also endure long hours on the road, maintain safety standards, and stay committed to the job despite the inherent challenges. The gravity of the issue hit me harder when we began losing contracts due to our inability to ensure timely deliveries.
We employed consultants who told us the problem was we were not getting enough applicants, so we went with an advertising agency, and we were receiving more applications, but the returns were far from satisfactory. Then the consultant told us our problem was that we were not converting the applicants into employees. So we should raise our wages. We were fighting an uphill battle, and I realized the necessity of a transformational shift in our approach.
This chapter is a deep dive into that revelation, the revolution of recruitment with AI and automation. I invite you to join me on this journey as I recount my experiences, the lessons learned, and the transformation that ensued. I believe this could be the pivotal turn you've been seeking in your recruitment strategy.
This chapter will cover:
1.	An introduction to AI-powered recruitment and its potential.
2.	A detailed breakdown of how AI and automation work in recruitment.

Ever since the advent of Industry 4.0 in 2011 with advanced automation, the world has witnessed an increasing usage of AI and automation across industries. AI has seeped into various business processes, from manufacturing to healthcare, retail to logistics, enhancing efficiency, productivity, and decision-making. As the world adapts to this new era of brilliant technologies, it's time for us, the trucking and logistics industry leaders, to take the leap and harness the power of AI for our recruitment and retention needs.
The road ahead may seem daunting, but as we embark on this transformative journey together, the opportunities for growth and prosperity are limitless.

Section 1: Introduction to AI-Powered Recruiter and Its Potential
Artificial Intelligence (AI), for the uninitiated, may seem like a concept straight out of a science fiction novel. But in reality, it is a technology that has been influencing our lives in ways we often fail to recognize - from online shopping recommendations to email spam filters, from voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to social media feeds. In the business world, AI has been a catalyst for significant advancements, with recruitment being one of the prime beneficiaries. 
Let me introduce you to the AI-Powered Recruiter. AI-powered recruitment essentially applies machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics in hiring processes. By harnessing the power of AI, companies can streamline their recruitment efforts, making them more efficient and effective. But why is AI so relevant in recruitment, particularly in an industry as traditional as trucking and logistics? Let's explore.
In the logistics industry, a profession like truck driving demands specific qualifications, skills, and mental and physical fortitude. Traditional recruitment methods, while necessary, are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. A job posting used to generate 20 to 30 applications. Nowadays, you would be Lucky to get 10 (qualified), out of which only a handful might be viable candidates if you are lucky. Getting these new canidates to talk to a recruiter is harder than you would think. Nowadays, most canidates, especially millennials and Gen Z, apply by filling out a mini application or submitting a resume. This makes qualifying these new applicants time-consuming, and following up to schedule initial interviews require significant human resources and time.
Enter AI. An AI-powered recruiter. A complete hiring system that automates these repetitive, time-consuming tasks, and gets canidates to contact your recruiters.  Freeing up the recruiters' time for more strategic activities. Imagine an intelligent system that can re-engage the qualified canidates that dropped out of your recruitment cycle. And deliver more qualified canidates to your job offer and even schedule interviews with the most suitable applicants. Not only does it accelerate the recruitment process, but it also reduces the likelihood of missing out on a promising candidate.
Moreover, AI can drastically improve the quality of hire. Advanced algorithms can analyze vast data points, including a candidate's experience, skills, qualifications, and even soft factors like cultural fit and personality traits. This data-driven approach ensures that the candidates shortlisted for the interview stage are not just qualified but are also likely to succeed and stay with the company for a longer period.
The most exciting advantage of AI is its predictive capabilities. With machine learning algorithms, AI can analyze historical hiring data and predict future hiring outcomes. For example, it can predict which candidates are more likely to accept a job offer, which recruits are likely to stay longer, or which potential hires may become A Players. Such insights can be incredibly valuable in strategic decision-making and planning.
However, the introduction of AI in recruitment is not just about addressing the current challenges. It’s about gearing up for the future. In a world where digital literacy and tech-savviness are becoming as crucial as traditional skills, adopting AI can enhance an organization’s employer brand image, making it more attractive to the younger, tech-savvy generation of workers.
Indeed, AI-powered recruiter holds enormous potential for the trucking and logistics industry. It promises a future where the best talent can be identified, recruited, and retained efficiently and effectively. Yet, as with any technology, understanding its working mechanism is crucial for successful implementation. The following section will dissect how AI and automation operate in recruitment.
Section 2: Breakdown of How AI and Automation Work in the Recruitment Process
At first glance, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation in recruitment may seem like a complex web of algorithms and data points. However, when broken down, it reveals itself as a seamless integration of intelligent processes and systems designed to enhance efficiency and precision in hiring. To truly appreciate AI’s revolution in recruitment, let us delve into its operational mechanics.
The heart of the AI-powered recruiter hiring system is the three-part framework for reshaping recruitment & retention in the digital transformation of hiring. So, you can hire high-performing employees. Even if you are not the highest paying job or offer a sign-on bonus no matter the market conditions. Helping you beat out bigger companies with more resources and bigger recruitment teams.   
The system's first part is Hire up Funnels, our primary technology. We use several different types of technologies to perform specific tasks. In our recruitment and retention software strategy. Hire Up funnels is designed to automate repetitive tasks and make it faster and easier to engage candidates so more make it to your job offer. 

To do this, we have three actions running at the same time in the background. The first action is workflow process automation. To ensure efficiency in processing new canidates. The second action is communication automation through mutable communication channels. To ensure every candidate gets the same great experience to increase engagement. The third action is check and balance rules. To ensure that your canidates are followed up according to your business best practices. And come with the strategy already programmed for you; no tech skills are required. The reason funnels are great is that they are predictable and automated.
 
The heart of AI-powered recruiter lies in its ability to parse vast amounts of data quickly and accurately. This involves two crucial components: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). 
NLP is an AI tool that allows computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a meaningful way. In the recruitment context, NLP can analyze resumes, job descriptions, emails, and even social media activity, extracting relevant information about the candidate's qualifications, experience, skills, and more. 
We can now harness the power of the world’s best copywriters… with Chat GPT. This one part of AI has completely changed my business. Before Chat GPT if you want to hire me as your recruitment strategist to build out your recruitment online strategy. I also came up with a team of top people to execute the strategy. The cost made the service out of budget for most companies. Now that I use AI, I have reduced the cost of my services by 80% and provided a better service. Allowing me to offer my services to a wider audience now. 
The second part of the AI-Powered Recruiter hiring system is My four-part framework for creating messaging that appeals to the ""human nature"" in all us. Based on Abraham Maslow's phycological theory of human needs. So, your employer brand and career messing talks ""to"" your candidates. Not ""at"" your candidates. So you have a message that impacts job seekers.   
Meanwhile, Machine Learning algorithms learn from historical data to make predictions about future outcomes. For instance, by analyzing the data of past successful hires, an ML tool can identify patterns or common factors and use them to rank potential candidates. Thus, not only can ML tools help screen and shortlist candidates, but they can also predict their potential for success in the role.
Another significant aspect of AI-powered recruiter is automation. Automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks that would typically require human intervention. In recruitment, automation can significantly streamline the process by taking over repetitive, time-consuming tasks.
For example, consider the task of scheduling interviews. Coordinating schedules between recruiters and candidates can be a tedious back-and-forth process. Automation with decision logic can handle this task efficiently, syncing with all parties’ calendars, proposing suitable time slots, and sending reminders when the interview date approaches.
Overall, automation with decision logic provides greater control. Customization and efficiency compared to automation without decision logic. Automation with decision logic provides more flexibility and control over the automation process. Decision logic allows for introducing conditions, and branching. And other more advanced options for the automation process can help fine-tune the automation's behavior to match the desired outcomes better. This can lead to more personalized experiences for candidates. improved efficiency for your recruitment team, and better results. In contrast, automation is without decision logic. It is limited to simple, linear processes that do not allow much customization or variability.
Then there's the automation of candidate communication. One of the ways to dramatically increase your recruiter’s productivity is to automate their communication. We use eight main recruitment funnels to automate our omnichannel communication. Call, Text, email, and pixel targeting. All the messaging funnels are designed to engage your candidates.  
AI-powered chatbots can interact with candidates, answering their queries, providing them with job information, and even gathering basic details for preliminary screening.
But perhaps the most remarkable use of automation in recruitment lies in the area of check and balance rules. The problem with recruitment software is that management has no idea how their team is using it. AI-Powered Recruiter’s strategic design also provides management of real-time data if canidates are not handled according to business rules. To maximize the application-to-job offer ratio for the best job-to-candidate match.  
One of the biggest mistakes recruiters make is, not following up with new canidates fast enough. It is important to get back to new canidates right away. Data shows that if you return your candidates' first call, text, application, or resume within 15 minutes, you are six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. This means that if you wait longer than 15 minutes to get back to a new candidate, you have already lost them. The variable for success is the speed at which the new candidate is followed up, not the recruiter’s skill. That we can control with automation. 
To make sure that best practices are being followed and that the ball doesn't get dropped when it comes to following up with candidates, Hire Up Funnels incorporate Check and Balance Rules. This automatically sends a reminder to the recruiter to contact the candidate, and if it happens twice in a row, the recruitment manager gets a notification that business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving them time to execute a backup plan so that a hiring deadline is not missed.  
Hire Up Funnels are just one piece of the AI-Powered Recruiter hiring system! AI-powered sourcing tools can scour the web, from job boards to social media platforms, to find potential candidates who may not have even applied for your job opening.
To put it simply, the AI-powered recruitment system can be broken down into three main functions to get more qualified canidates to your job offer. The first is the technology we use to engage and interact with your candidates throughout the recruitment cycle. Hire up funnels. The second function is our employer brand and recruitment messaging. based in phycology so you are talking to your candidates versus talking at your canidates. The third function is data driver recruitment. 
Despite the apparent complexity, the working of AI and automation in recruitment is based on the core principle of efficiency - reducing manual effort, accelerating the process, and enhancing the precision of hiring decisions. Yet, as I discovered, transitioning from traditional recruitment methods to AI-powered recruitment wasn't entirely smooth sailing. In the next section, I'll share my initial experiences and challenges in adopting AI for recruitment.
Section 3: The First Brush with AI in Recruitment and the Initial Challenges
As a seasoned professional in the transportation and logistics industry, I've weathered my fair share of storms. But nothing prepared me for the force of change brought on by AI in recruitment and retention. My first encounter with it was not as smooth as its promised precise operations. In fact, it was quite the opposite—a messy confluence of fear, uncertainty, and skepticism.
When the concept of AI-powered recruitment was first introduced to me, it felt like being handed the helm of a high-tech spaceship after years of navigating a traditional sailboat. The dashboard was replete with dials and buttons that I didn’t understand. Instead of the familiar compass and sextant, I was staring at advanced radar and GPS systems, promising unparalleled accuracy and efficiency.
It wasn't just the steep learning curve that was daunting; it was also the prevalent apprehension about AI—misgivings about machines taking over jobs and reducing the 'human touch' in processes, concerns about privacy and data security, and skepticism about the actual benefits of AI versus its cost.
As I struggled with these challenges, a realization dawned upon me. It wasn't the technology itself that was the obstacle; it was our resistance to change, our fear of the unknown. And it wasn't until I addressed these fears that I could unlock the true potential of AI in recruitment.
So, I embarked on a mission to dispel these fears and misconceptions, beginning with education. I reached out to experts, attended seminars, read widely on the subject, and even took online courses. I familiarized myself with AI jargon and how it worked, and as my understanding grew, so did my confidence.
Then came the task of convincing the rest of the team. There was significant resistance from the recruiters who feared that automation would render them obsolete. I reassured them that AI wouldn’t replace them but instead augment their capabilities. AI could take care of the time-consuming, repetitive administrative tasks, giving them more time to engage with the candidates and make informed decisions.
I also had to address concerns about data privacy. I ensured that the AI tools we used were compliant with data protection laws and that the candidates’ information was safe. We even decided to take a radical stance on AI decision-making tools. All hiring decisions will be made by human beings, people. As part of our Hybrid AI strategy. Our team will use the data from AI as just a part of the decision-making process, not the complete decision-making process. And if and when we use an automated decision-making AI tool. I will be certified as non-bias or will not use it. To protect us against any lawsuits. 
Finally, to tackle the skepticism about the benefits of AI, I decided to run a pilot project. We used an AI-powered automated recruitment funnel on a small scale to hire for a couple of roles. The results were impressive—the process was faster, the candidates were high quality, and the recruiters found they had more time to engage with the candidates.
The initial challenges in adopting AI for recruitment were not trivial but surmountable. And the payoff was worth the struggle. In the next section, we will delve into the insights gleaned from ""The Second Machine Age"" and ""Moneyball,"" both of which elucidate the power of data-driven strategies in recruitment.
Section 4: Insight into the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on Data-Driven Strategies
When I first picked up ""The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies"" by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, little did I know how profound an impact it would have on my approach to recruitment. The book unravels the transformative power of digital technologies and automation, arguing that we are at the dawn of a second machine age, marked by advancements that will dwarf those of the Industrial Revolution.
The core of the second machine age, as Brynjolfsson and McAfee outline, is the explosion of data. We live in a world overflowing with digital information, and the book posits that the organizations which can harvest and harness this data will be the victors of the new age. When correctly leveraged, data could generate insights and solutions that human intuition alone may fail to grasp.
For me, this message resonated deeply. The significance of data-driven decision-making in recruitment became clear as day. The thousands of resumes we sifted through, the endless interviews conducted—all generated data. Yet, were we utilizing this information effectively? Or were we just drowning in it, overwhelmed and unable to extract valuable insights?
Meanwhile, ""Moneyball,"" a movie based on the real-life story of the Oakland A's baseball team, served as a practical illustration of the power of data analytics. The team's manager, Billy Beane, frustrated by budget constraints and unable to compete with wealthier teams for star players, turned to data analytics to select undervalued players. His unconventional strategy turned the tide for his team and disrupted traditional methods of player selection.
The parallels with the recruitment industry were obvious. Like Billy Beane, we were vying for talent in a fiercely competitive market. And just as Beane used analytics to identify underappreciated talent, we too could leverage AI to unearth potential candidates overlooked by traditional recruitment methods. Moreover, data analytics could help us optimize our recruitment strategies, target our outreach more effectively, and make more informed hiring decisions.
Both ""The Second Machine Age"" and ""Moneyball"" drove home the message that those who wield data with dexterity are destined to succeed in the age of information. For us in the recruitment industry, AI and automation emerged not merely as buzzwords but as powerful tools to survive and thrive in the digital era.
Section 5: Conclusion - Harnessing AI & Automation for Recruitment Success
Looking back on my journey of embracing AI and automation in recruitment, I see a clear evolution—from initial skepticism and apprehension to acceptance and enthusiastic advocacy. My experiences with AI in recruitment have reshaped my perspectives and revolutionized our recruitment strategy, echoing the transformative power of technology highlighted in ""The Second Machine Age"" and the pivotal role of data-driven decision-making showcased in ""Moneyball.""
The recruitment landscape is undeniably shifting beneath our feet, with AI and automation ushering in a new era of efficiency, precision, and insight-driven decisions. With hybrid AI, the human touch will always remain an integral part of our recruitment strategy, there's no denying that AI has the potential to augment our abilities, improve our processes, and enhance our results.
With the AI-powered recruiter, you can speed up and streamline the recruitment process, freeing recruiters from the tedious, time-consuming administrative tasks to focus on what truly matters—building meaningful connections with potential hires. We can leverage machine learning algorithms to sift through massive data sets and identify patterns that might escape the human eye, enabling us to make more informed hiring decisions.
Furthermore, predictive analytics allows us to anticipate and address potential retention hurdles, enabling us to attract and retain talent more effectively. We can personalize our messaging and engagement, delivering tailored experiences that resonate with individual candidates and foster stronger relationships.
However, to harness the full potential of AI and automation, we must navigate the inevitable challenges that come with adopting new technology. Addressing fears, overcoming resistance, and ensuring data security are crucial steps in this journey. It's a journey marked by learning, adaptation, and resilience—a journey well worth embarking on, considering AI’s transformative impact on our recruitment and retention process.
AI and automation are not distant prospects of the future; they're here and now, ready to be leveraged by those willing to embrace change and innovation. As we stand at the brink of the second machine age, we have a choice—to shy away from the unfamiliar or to bravely venture into uncharted territories armed with the power of data and AI.
As I conclude this chapter, I invite you to choose the latter. Embrace the revolution of AI and automation in recruitment. Harness the power of data to navigate the turbulent seas of talent acquisition. And when you do, you'll find that you can weather the storm and chart a course to unparalleled success in recruitment.

Level the playing field, outshine competition, and attract top talent with AI-powered technology. 🚀 #ReshapingRecruitment #GameChanger #AIPoweredRecruiter #HybirdAIforHiring #DataDrivenRecruitment",Introduction,"Picture this: A time in the not-so-distant future where job applications are screened, shortlisted, interviewed, and hired, not by human beings, but by artificial intelligence. Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

Our Multicultural Transportation Managers offer diverse perspective & expertise, improving hiring & retention. Join the recruitment future now! #AIRecruitment #AutomationRevolution #DiversePerspective",Introduction,"Picture this: A time in the not-so-distant future where job applications are screened, shortlisted, interviewed, and hired, not by human beings, but by artificial intelligence. Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.

Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

They give us direction, motivation, and focus, helping us prioritize our time and resources to achieve what is truly important to us.                                                    Goals are important in helping us discover our purpose because they give us a sense of direction and meaning in life. They help us identify our passions, strengths, and values, which are essential components of our purpose. When we set goals that align with our purpose, we become more motivated, engaged, and fulfilled in our lives. We have to name and claim our gifts and talents and goals are a key mechanism for uncovering and developing our passions and living a life of purpose and prosperity. Goals allow us to create space in our busy lives to focus our energy, thoughts and feelings on the things we would really love to have, do or be in our lives. 

The key here is the ability to focus on what it is you really want, write it down and claim it. """,1,2023-08-30T18:47:13.355785,13,1,blue,1,1,2023-08-02T18:16:13.201207,False,informational,did-you-know-2-cta

Dive into a world of knowledge, growth, and success with us. #OneBookMillionaire #ReadingIsWealth",Chapter 1: Unleashing Your Power: R.E.S.O.U.R.C.E.S for Unstoppable Success,"Hey Y’all! This is AI Zachariah and I present to you the One Book Millionaire. 

With this book, you're about to embark on a journey that will catapult you from an unknown quantity to a brand rockstar, transforming you into a recognizable figure who is valued based on your purpose and impact.

So what is the One Book Millionaire? It is an iterative process that uses the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to turn everyday authors into everyday millionaires.

We all know that some people like to skip dessert first, so let me give you the dessert first. How you get to become a millionaire is by starting to write a book. 

Most of you might be thinking how do you even write a book? You might be wondering or perhaps you are unsure how to even begin writing your very own bestselling book. But do not worry—we've got you covered. We've got your back with the 96 Hour Book Challenge. 

What you need to do is to take the 96 Hour Book Challenge, and you'll be on your way.

WE USE AI!!!!!


Although I just want you to remember, technology, especially AI, should never be a shortcut—it should be an enhancer. 

You wouldn't want a steak cooked in the microwave for three minutes, would you? So, let's slow-cook your success on the grill, infusing it with the steak butter, rosemary and thyme we need for all the flavors of your raw resources.

Remember, ALWAYS START with the end in mind. 

So who is this book for?

If you're a speaker, coach, author, or thought leader feeling underappreciated and unseen in the market, this book is for you.

Most people don't have the success that they want. That is because they are not fit, they are not millionaire fit. Just like how you get fit in the gym, you can also become a millionaire fit…

Writing a book and making a million dollars might sound tough, but it's as easy as flipping a 500 pound tire… when you've got the right resources and mindset. It's time to flip the tire, make that financial win, and turn yourself into a brand rockstar.

I'm a big fitness guy. I believe that the discipline and motivation it takes to be successful in the gym is what can launch you to success in becoming a One Book Millionaire.. It's all about using your inherent raw resources to achieve maximum results.

Your raw resources are your experiences, expertise, and personality. Throughout this journey, you'll learn the importance of  using your raw resources in achieving success. 

Notice that I didn't say, what's in your bank account, what certification you have or a PhD, the history of your family, what house you're in, or what car you drive… NONE OF THAT SHIT MATTERS. You only need to harness the power of your raw resources.

I can share with you that I've sold $20,000 programs with just a Google doc and a Stripe link, all because I knew one thing: how to harness my raw resources.

What do I mean by being R.A.W.? 

Real Transparency
Authenticity
Willingness to be vulnerable

Be authentic and transparent. That's the key.

Get RAW. 

So what are your R.E.S.O.U.R.C.E.S?

Relatable Stories
Experience
Skillset
Open Communication
Unwavering Commitment
Resourcefulness
Collaboration
Empathy
Strategic Planning

Harness your power using your R.E.S.O.U.R.C.E.S.

This book will show you how to stop underestimating the value of these resources and leverage them to create a powerful, authentic, and transparent narrative.

Are you ready to stop wasting time?

Are you ready to live the life of your dreams?

Are you ready to finally become the coach you know you are always meant to be and make the kind of money that you know you're always meant to make?

It's time to become millionaire-fit by completing the One Book Millionaire training.

AI and automation revolutionize hiring, streamlining recruitment for maximum efficiency and success. Stay ahead, find top talent. #TransportationIndustry #Innovation #HiringRevolution",Chapter 1: Navigating the Hiring Highway,"
Over two decades ago, when I first entered the fascinating world of trucking and logistics recruitment, it was a different era. Hiring was a straightforward process back then, perhaps even rudimentary compared to today's standards. The industry was growing, and jobs were plentiful. Looking back, those were the days of simplicity in the hiring landscape.
But as the adage goes, ""Change is the only constant."" The tides of time swirled, and so did the logistics and trucking industry. The big problem was the driver shortage, a persistent thorn in the side of an industry otherwise buzzing with opportunity. It felt like being stranded on a highway with a truck full of promises but no drivers to steer it.
I struggled with this relentless challenge, tirelessly brainstorming strategies to attract and retain the drivers we hired. At times, it seemed like an impossible task. But I wasn't alone. The entire industry was facing the same predicament. We just started the AI revolution, and industries worldwide were turning to technology as their savior. Intrigued and inspired, I contemplated if AI could be our knight in shining armor.
The world event that revolutionized hiring was the adoption of Chat GPT. AI and automation in recruitment and retention processes. It happened slowly at first, but its impact was profound. Companies using AI and automation were beating out companies not using AI and automation. Companies started using AI-powered recruitment systems to automate recruitment workflows and automate communication through omnichannel. They even had ways to inform you how fast your recruitment team returned canidates calls and texts, ensuring the best canidates to application ratio. And no canidates get ghosted, providing a great candidate experience. So more of your qualified candidates make it to your job offer. Giving your team the canidates needed to make the best job-to-candidate match. 
From the shadows of this transformation emerged a glimmer of hope. Could we, too, harness the power of technology to tackle our recruitment woes? The promise was enticing, and the opportunity immense.
In this chapter, we'll traverse the hiring highway, shedding light on traditional hiring methods and exploring the role of technology in modern hiring processes. We'll delve into my personal journey and how my perspective on hiring has evolved. Drawing inspiration from the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" and the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" we'll learn to identify talent and overcome adversity. Buckle up, for an enlightening ride awaits us on the hiring highway.
Section 1 - Analysis of traditional hiring methods in the trucking industry
Steering back to the beginning of my career, hiring in the trucking industry was an art rooted in gut feelings, intuition, and personal judgment. Candidates were assessed primarily based on their ability to handle a truck, commitment to the job, and willingness to spend long hours on the road. They were face-to-face interactions, handshake deals, and decisions made around the coffee table. It was all incredibly human and intensely personal.
The process took time and often hit-or-miss. While we celebrated when we found the right fit, it was back to square one when we didn't. It was incredibly challenging to assess a candidate's commitment, adaptability, and resilience through just an interview or two. Our assessment was based largely on their past driving record and the charm of their personality.
Furthermore, the hiring process was localized. We predominantly relied on local talent pools or word-of-mouth referrals. Our go-to recruitment strategy was placing a help wanted ad in the local newspaper or at the town job fair to fill jobs. In some ways, it was comforting, familiar. But it was also limiting.
This traditional approach began showing its cracks as the industry grew more competitive. Trucking is about more than just driving from point A to point B. It's about adhering to tight schedules, maintaining the vehicle, managing on-road challenges, and ensuring the safe and timely delivery of goods while being a customer service rep. And most importantly, it's about doing all this consistently, day in and day out, while providing a great customer experience. 
These complexities were often overlooked in traditional hiring practices. As a result, we ended up hiring drivers who were good at driving but needed help with the other aspects of the job. The result? High turnover rates and a constant struggle to keep our complete fleet on the road.
As I navigated these challenges, I saw the need for a more robust, comprehensive hiring strategy that considered a candidate’s driving skills and overall suitability for the job. The seeds of change were sown. But what I needed was a game changer, a revolutionary approach that would take our hiring strategy from basic to brilliant.
Section 2 - The Role of Technology in modern hiring processes
The AI (artificial intelligence) Technology revolution began to assert its role in the modern hiring process during this quest for a new approach. Inspired by industries that were seamlessly integrating AI and automation in their hiring practices, I pondered upon its potential in ours.
As we dove deeper into the realm of technology, we discovered a world brimming with possibilities. Candidate Relation Management Systems (CRM) Built on advanced automation platforms. Equipped with AI capabilities were revolutionizing the way hiring was done. 
The sophisticated system had four different advanced automation systems running in the background. To provide your team with the right tools and system to streamline the recruitment processes. It promised recruiter efficiency, accuracy, and a significant reduction in time-to-hire by providing a great candidate experience. 
Moreover, data-driven hiring became a possibility. We could analyze historical data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. AI brought the power of predictive analytics, enabling us to foresee hiring trends, anticipate needs, and strategize accordingly. We could answer critical questions like: What traits do our best drivers share? What makes a driver stay with us for the long term?
Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual reality tools opened avenues for a more engaging candidate experience. Prospective drivers could interact with chatbots to get immediate answers to their queries. Virtual reality could give them a realistic simulation of their job, leading to better-informed decisions.
The role of technology in modern hiring processes extends beyond just finding and hiring the right candidate. It also played a significant part in onboarding and retaining the hired talent. Technology made keeping the drivers engaged and committed easier, from AI-assisted onboarding programs to regular check-ins and feedback loops.
Looking at all these possibilities, I was in awe of how technology could be a game changer. It had the potential to address the very issues we had been struggling with. It was a revolutionary, data-driven, and efficient approach to an age-old problem. As I stood on the brink of this technological revolution, I was convinced that this was the path we needed to tread.
Section 3 - My journey and the evolution of my perspective on hiring
In my journey from just a recruiter to being the top Digital Recruitment and Retention Strategies for the trucking and logistics industry.  I've weathered numerous storms and celebrated countless victories. Each phase offered a learning experience and substantially altered my perspective on hiring.
I started my career when hiring was primarily a personal affair. Hiring is based on a face-to-face interview and a person’s willingness to work hard. It was the age of intuition-based hiring. That's not to say it was flawed - I was a testament to its success. But as I moved up the ladder, I realized it was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.
I remember distinctly, a time in the early stages of my recruitment career when we were struggling with high turnover. We had a team of hard-working drivers, but they weren't staying. The strain of long hours, tight schedules, and road challenges was taking its toll. This was my first brush with the limitations of traditional hiring methods.
I realized then that hiring for the trucking industry needed more than just intuition - it required understanding the complexities of the job and assessing the candidate's capability to handle them. It was about hiring drivers who wouldn't just drive but thrive in the high-pressure, challenging trucking environment of today.
As I wrestled with these challenges, I discovered the potential of technology to transform our hiring process. What initially seemed like a daunting, almost alien concept started making sense. The more I delved into it, the more I saw its potential to streamline our hiring, expand our reach, and drastically improve our success rate.
My journey through the adoption of AI in hiring echoed the broader AI revolution that was transforming industries worldwide. It was a period of rapid evolution and change. Companies that embraced AI and advanced automation were propelling ahead, while those that resisted were falling behind.
In this whirlwind of change, I found inspiration in the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. They advocated a data-driven, structured approach to hiring - a methodology that could potentially revolutionize our hiring process. I also found motivation in the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". The protagonist's resilience, commitment, and relentless pursuit of his dream was a reflection of the kind of drivers we wanted to hire. I was able to harness the power of AI by following the lead from wall street quants. The dynamic world of Wall Street, known for its rapid fortunes made or lost, has seen the game completely changed with the introduction of AI and Quants. 
These influences shaped my perspective, leading me to understand that the key to successful hiring lay in a harmonious blend of technology and human touch. Humanity was becoming the new technology. I realized that while AI and automation could do much of the heavy lifting, the human element was critical in making the final call. After all, it was about finding people who would be the face of our company on the road. 
Section 4 - Learning from the reference book and movie, with a focus on identifying talent and overcoming adversity
I found valuable lessons in ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. The book gave me the tools to chart a course in the tumultuous seas of hiring, particularly as it focused on hiring for attitude and potential. They emphasized how it's not always about the qualifications or experience; it's about who they are as individuals and whether they align with the company's values and culture.
Their concept of the A player - an employee that has at least a 90 percent chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10 percent of possible candidates could achieve - resonated deeply. The A player for us was a driver who not only drove but also represented our company's values, was the face of our company, maintained strong customer relationships, and upheld the highest safety standards.
However, finding these A players required a change in our hiring approach. We needed to look beyond just the driving skills and delve deeper into their attitude, resilience, and potential. We needed a structured, data-driven approach that combined technology and human intuition - the perfect blend of artificial and emotional intelligence. 
This reminded me of how AI gave Wall Street Firms an edge over the competition. However, when AI became widely adopted, this advantage faded. This is where Quants, the heroes of wall street, stepped in. They brought forth a revolutionary approach, Hybrid AI. Where we use the best of human intelligence paired with artificial intelligence. The firms that adopted this approach by the Quants pulled ahead of the competition, redefining the leaders on wall street. 
Wall streets evolution parallels the current state of recruitment and retention. As quants disrupted Wall Street with Hybrid AI, recruitment and retention strategist are becoming the “quants” of HR. We are using Hybrid AI to improve recruitment and retention in the trucking and logistics industry. Where humans make the final decision aided by the data from AI. 
This is where the lessons from the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" came into play. The protagonist, Chris Gardner, was the embodiment of resilience and determination. He was a man with limited resources and opportunities, yet his unyielding determination to provide for his son and pursue his dream job was inspiring.
Gardner was a perfect example of an A player. He didn't have the qualifications or experience, but his attitude and resilience were unmatched. He was the kind of driver we wanted - one who would persist through challenges, remain committed to the job, and continuously strive for excellence.
The movie was a stark reminder that adversities can be overcome with a resilient spirit and a relentless pursuit of happiness. It was a reflection of the challenges our drivers faced - long hours, road hazards, solitude - and yet, with the right attitude and support, they could overcome them.
Bringing these lessons into our hiring process, we reshaped our strategy. We deployed AI tools to screen for skill-based parameters, freeing us to focus on personal traits during interviews. We looked for traits like resilience, determination, and a positive attitude, traits that we had overlooked in our traditional hiring approach.
We started conducting behavioral interviews, posing situational questions to assess how they would react in challenging scenarios. How did they handle a particularly challenging delivery? How did they cope with the solitude on long hauls? How did they deal with difficult customers or situations?
We began to see a change as we integrated these lessons into our hiring process. Our hiring decisions were becoming more informed, our driver pool was strengthening, and our retention rates were improving. We were making headway in our battle with the driver shortage.
Section 5 - Conclusion: Navigating the Road Ahead
The transformation in our recruitment approach was not an overnight occurrence; it was a journey paved with trials, errors, and learnings. However, these changes were essential and long overdue, not just for our company but for the trucking industry as a whole.
The lessons we learned, the improvements we made, and the progress we witnessed were encouraging. We managed to turn the wheels of our recruitment process, steering it away from traditional, limiting hiring practices towards a future defined by innovation, inclusivity, and intelligence. We succeeded in integrating the nuances of our industry, the essence of our drivers, and the power of technology into our hiring process.
Yet, as with any journey, ours is ongoing, and we continue to learn, adapt, and evolve. We are by no means perfect, and the driver shortage problem is far from resolved. But we are better than the competition, and that's what matters.
The AI revolution is reshaping recruitment and retention in the trucking industry, and its adoption is not a matter of” if” but “when.” The driver shortage is a pressing issue that warrants immediate attention and creative solutions. Advanced technology, AI, and automation present themselves as powerful allies in this fight. If you can connect the dots of strategy to use AI and advanced automation for you. 
The integration of technology in our hiring process has offered us insights, solutions, and opportunities we could not have imagined. It has allowed us to explore a wealth of untapped potential and resources that can prove to be game-changers in our industry.
However, technology is only a tool; its successful implementation and impact depend heavily on the user. A hammer in the hands of a child is merely a toy, but in the hands of a sculptor, it can create masterpieces. Similarly, AI and automation can transform the recruitment landscape in our industry, but only if used strategically and wisely.
And in this endeavor, empathy and understanding are our guiding lights. It's about remembering that behind every application and resume is a person with hopes, dreams, fears, and responsibilities. It's about knowing that a driver is not just a worker, but an ambassador of our company, a custodian of our goods, and a crucial link in our economic chain.
I implore other industry leaders, HR professionals, and transport managers to embrace this new dawn, challenge traditional norms, and navigate uncharted territories. The road ahead is uncertain, filled with challenges and opportunities alike. But if we navigate it together, sharing insights, learnings, and best practices, we can shape a future where driver shortages are a thing of the past, and the industry thrives with committed, competent, and content drivers.
Let this chapter serve as an invitation to embark on this transformative journey where technology meets talent acquisition. Remember, it's not about merely surviving the driver shortage but thriving through it.
Action Steps:
1.	Challenge the Norms: Question your existing recruitment practices. Are they effective? Are they limiting your pool of potential drivers?
2.	Adopt Technology: Embrace the use of AI and automation in your hiring process. Use them to streamline processes, broaden your search, and facilitate better decision-making.
3.	Focus on the Person, Not Just the Driver: Look beyond driving skills and qualifications. Assess attitudes, values, and potential. Remember, you're hiring a person, not just a driver.
4.	Learn and Adapt: Stay updated with industry trends, technological advancements, and best practices. Learn from others and be willing to adapt your processes accordingly.
5.	Share Your Insights: Don't keep your learnings to yourself. Share them with others in the industry. Remember, we're in this together.

Seamlessly integrate digital transformation, AI, and automation to find top talent. Embrace innovation for an efficient and effective hiring process. #RecruitmentRevamp #DigitalTransformation #AIInnovation",Chapter 3 Speed is what matters.,"I remember like it yesterday. I had landed a giant recruitment contract. But I did not know I was not the only recruitment company with the contract. They also contracted with one of my biggest competitors. 
The big company had more people and more resources, and they were using them to beat me out for all the placements. I was in the fight of my business life. They did not like me being there and were determined to push me out. I needed to make placements, or I would lose the contract, and the big company would win. 

So I decided I would use the shotgun approach. I upped my advertising budget again and did a text message campaign for the candidates that were on my list (candidates I own). It kind of worked, and kind of didn’t work... here is what I mean. The number of candidates that responded to our job posting & text message campaign increased.   

But the number of people we hired only increased for some recruiters and not others. The strange thing I noticed about the results is. I would have 2 recruiters with the same skill set and get two wildly different results from them. You would think the results would be similar to each other. It was frustrating...I suspected that something was up. If I could solve this puzzle, I could easily double my profits with the same number of resources, ad spend, and effort I am using now.  

I started searching for any study, report, or any bit of creditable information on what would cause such a difference in performance with two equally skilled recruiters. I read article after article clicking link after link in the articles for what seemed like weeks until I finally ended up finding a study by Harvard business review. I found a study on sales companies' response rates 
 

Our research shows that most companies are not responding nearly fast enough… our research indicates that many firms are too slow to follow up on these leads. We audited 2,241 U.S. companies…. 24% took more than 24 hours—and 23% of the companies never responded at all. The average response time…. was 42 hours.  
These results are especially shocking given how quickly online leads go cold. Firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times as likely to qualify the lead….as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later—and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer.”’ 
Source: Harvard Business Review 
https://timetoreply.com/harvard-business-review/ 
 
The first time I read the report, I thought it had valuable information. And I put the report in my file to read again. I continued my search, but I could not find anything that useful. A few weeks passed, and I picked up the Harvard business review report to read it again. When I finished reading the report, I came to a different conclusion. Have you ever experienced that? You get a different message from the same report or book on a different read. 

This time reading the report, I realized the variable for success was not the sales skill of the salesperson. The variable for success was the speed at which the salesperson responded to the lead. Only after the salesperson was talking to a prospect did the sales skill come into play. 

I wondered if that was happening with my recruitment team. It would explain the discrepancy between the two recruiters with similar skills. With these market conditions, candidates rule the hiring process. Who knows. First, I needed to know how fast we respond to new candidates. To do that, we had to pull reporting from our phone system. And reporting from our hire-up funnel software and cross reference that will the call report to get the full picture. We broke it down by each recruiter extension and transfer.  

Here is what we uncovered each recruiter handled their new candidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason on how my recruiters responded to the new canidates they received from our advertising.  As we studied the data, a pattern started to emerge. We cross-referenced that with the placements report, and my suspicions were confirmed.  

Some of our recruiters responded to new canidates on the day they applied and they filled a lot more jobs than the recruiters that responded the following day or the following two days. There was a direct correlation between how fast a call, text, or resume was responded to by a recruiter. And the total number of people hired by that recruiter. 

The Harvard Business Review Report proved to ring true in recruiting candidates from the Internet. This means we lost a lot of candidates, which cost a lot of money. And wasted a lot of our recruiter's time following up trying to get these canidates on the phone to qualify. All because we delayed responding to new canidates one day. Is your team doing the same thing?  

Section 1 Ghosting Canidates 

That reminded me of a project we did for a client. They were having all kinds of issues with their hiring. So we did a survey of all the candidates they did not hire, and the results were eye-opening 30% of the candidates said that the recruiter ghosted them. Almost half of the ghosted candidates said it happened more than two times.    
 
This damaged their employer's brand. And can have a negative effect on future candidates from applying. It is critical that candidate ghosting does not happen. And adequate and appropriate feedback given to job seekers. No matter what stage of the hiring process they are in.    
 
Reshaping recruitment and retention is all about human interaction. It is not just about AI or an online experience; it has a human element. So, you must integrate human interaction with technology and AI to achieve the greatest results, hybrid AI. I worked with the team to determine the best way to respond to new candidates from our advertising. After weeks of trial and error. We tested different timelines on hundreds of new candidates from our advertising.   
 
AI crunched the data and showed that if we returned our candidates' first call. Text, application or resume within 15 minutes. We were six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. The team agreed that 15 minutes was a reasonable time to respond. So that became the new business rule.    
 
Section 2 Check & Balance:  

After that experience, I realized I needed a check and balance system. To ensure that my recruiters were treating each and every candidate the same. And the system informs the management team when business processes are not being followed. Or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure you do not miss a hiring deadline. To carry out this. We use check and balance rules in the workflow that could not be possible without automation with decision logic.    
 
Having check and balance rules in Hire up Funnels was an eye-opening experience for me. Before we put our check and balance in the workflow. We had no way to measure how our recruitment team followed up with canidates. Just like most of you.    
 
I did not know how long it took our recruiters to respond to new candidates from our advertising. Or if they were getting ghosted, It was like flying blind. With our check and balance rules. You will know if all your business’s best practices and recruitment rules are followed. Ensuring recruiter efficacy and good candidate experience. like flying with instruments, you know if you are on course or not, so you can correct and get back on track.    
 
Here is how the check and balance rules work. If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. Call a candidate back within 15 min of receiving a new candidate. The check and balance workflow would send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task and e-mail. Ensure a prompt callback and make sure the new candidate is not ghosted.    
 
Suppose this happens two times in a row. And the candidate is not called within the time limit of our business rules. In that case, the workflow sends a notification to the assigned recruitment manager. Who can then figure out why the new candidate. That you spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules. For the highest advertising-to-interview conversion ratio.    
 
Ensuring all candidates get a great experience. You are more productive; you hire more of the qualified candidates you are already talking to. The Hire Up funnels workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate. So, you hire more of the qualified canidates you are already talking to. Never worry if your team is not following best practices and rules. Our check and balance rules will keep you informed.   

After giving our team the information and tools to improve their results. Our team now has an average 5-minute response time to new candidates from our advertising. All recruiters have increased the number of hires. Some so much that you would not believe me if I shared them with you. Check and balance rules can carry out various tasks. We use several versions throughout our Hire Up Funnels.   
 
Section 3 Follow up programmed in check and balance rules.    
 
I wanted to beat the big company for the most placements badly. I dug a little deeper in the data and started to see a new pattern. I shared it with the team, and they confirmed it. When a candidate calls, text, or submit a resume. And if the call went to voicemail or a text was not returned, that started a domino effect of complications. The most time-consuming was the never-ending game of phone tag. To get the candidate back on the phone or respond to your text so you could activate. And start the recruitment process of qualification.    
 
I returned to my Hire up Funnels software and pulled reporting of follow-up attempts. To successful calls where we got the candidate on the phone to do the prescreening call to qualify. And move to the next stage of the recruitment cycle success path. 
 
The results were like the new candidate from advertising results. Every recruiter handled the new canidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason for how many follow-up calls a recruiter made. Everyone on the team had a different number of follow-up calls. We shared the results with the team. The high-performing recruiters made more follow-up calls than the low-performer ones. The report told us that 20% of the team gave up after only two follow-up attempts. That was disappointing...   
 
I shared the results with the team to see the best way to fix this. The recruiters that responded with the least number of follow-up calls. Shared some very valuable information with us. The main reason for not making as many follow-up calls. Was that they felt like they were pestering the candidates. And felt like they were being pushy. I can understand that.    
 
So, the big question was. How many times should candidates be called for the best contact, qualification, and hiring ratios? And so, your team knows the number of calls to make that they are not bothering candidates. So, we tested the candidates we had. To see the correct number of follow-ups. To get a candidate that responded to our job advertisement. On the phone who did not answer the recruiters' first return call.   
 
We tested calling, texting, and sending e-mails, and pixel targeting. It was surprising to learn that you must do much more follow-up than one would think for a job.  But you do not want to overdo it, burn out your candidates, and destroy your reputation in your market. The sweet spot is to be persistent but not a stalker. The stats told us that we needed to follow up seven. To eight times to get a candidate activated on the phone (without upsetting them). To do a prescreen call and qualify.    
 
Digging even deeper into the data. We also discovered that if we did not get the candidate on the phone in the first seven days after applying with us. They went cold and non-responsive. The tests we ran told us we got more people on the phone to prescreen. And qualify if we used a combination of phone calls and text messages, and e-mails.    
 
On a fluke my lead recruiter suggested that we try using our AI chatbot in our follow-up messages. To give our canidates the option to use the AI chatbot to book time to talk to the recruiter, and boy, did they.   
 
Section 4 Follow-up rules.    
 
We added follow-up rules to our check and balance workflow with that data. When the recruiter calls the new candidate back, the call is unanswered. We have a control requiring eight follow-ups for every new candidate not activated. The recruiter calls the candidate every other day for eight days. When the recruiter does not call. We set up the workflow to send our omnichannel communication.    
 
This way, we reach out to our candidate eight times in six days. With four calls from the recruiter and four automated Omni channel communication. Including AI chatbots, to schedule a call with a recruiter. Increasing the efficiency of our recruitment team. Getting more people on the phone. And into the qualification stage of the recruitment cycle.    
 
If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. The workflow would automatically send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task in their calendar and e-mail. If your recruiter does not adhere to the follow-up rules. Another reminder task is sent if this happens twice in a row. The candidate is not called within the time frame of our business rules. Then the workflow sends a notification. To the assigned recruitment manager. Who can figure out why the new candidate. That we spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules time frame.    
 
 
Ensure all candidates have a great recruitment experience. And we are more productive, so we hire more of the qualified candidates we are already talking to. The recruitment funnel workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate.  
 
Section 5 Conclusion 
 
Here is how important a good candidate's experience is. According to career plug. 80% of candidates said that a positive candidate experience influenced their decision to say yes to an offer. 58% of job seekers said that a poor candidate experience led them to decline a job.    
https://www.careerplug.com/blog/improve-hiring-with-better-communication/  
 
So, I adjusted my funnel with the check and balance rules of 15 min to return a call. And programed eight follow ups for every new candidate and relaunched it. Did some optimization and the team started to hire more people. We started to beat the big company for placements. With the same resources I was spending before I made the changes to the check and balance rules. It was an all-out war for the top spot. One week they would take the top spot, and the next week, we would take the top spot. This went on for several weeks, the competition was fierce. It was technology strategy versus strength, who would win?    
 
With a dedicated team and the right tools. We were able to track, measure and optimize our recruitment funnels. To become number one, we held the top spot to the end of the recruitment contract. Technology strategy wins over strength every time...    
 
Success is achieved by adjusting technology. To accommodate human behavior opened a whole new world for me. What else can I do to gain market advantage? So, I studied the biggest technology companies. To figure out how they grew so fast and became market leaders.   
 
Remember, there is something much bigger at play here than just data. As the data increases and the metrics become more trackable, It is easy to get sucked into the analytics of it all. And in the process, forget that there is a person on the other side of the metrics. A person with a problem, a person who needs you to solve their problem.

Don't miss out on top talent! #PassiveJobSeekers #UnlockingPotential #AIPoweredRecruiter #DataDrivenRecruitment ,Introduction,"Picture this: A time in the not-so-distant future where job applications are screened, shortlisted, interviewed, and hired, not by human beings, but by artificial intelligence. Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

Were, out of nowhere. You meet the love of your life or a business partner or are exposed to an ideal that changes your life. You did not do anything… life brought it to you. I was lucky enough to have that happen to me on September 14th, 1992. I was at 303 2nd Street, 5th floor in San Francisco, California. 


It was the first day of work at my dream job in advertising. Wanting to start strong, I started working on a list of businesses that did not advertise with us. Trying to drum up some new business. I scheduled an appointment with a company to meet at my office the next day. He showed up disheveled looking, wearing a stained shirt with old shoes. I thought, what did I get myself into? We went to the conference room, and I got to know him and his business. It turns out he is one of San Francisco's biggest restauranteurs (never judge a book by its cover). He owned most of the restaurants in Fisherman Wharf and the crab stands on the sidewalk. We spent most of the day together. When we were done, we put together some great advertising campaigns. 


He required a lot of extra work from me, like creating a process map of how the advertising would be handled. I had to set up tracking phone numbers. And document what ads had what unique phone number. So we can track which advertising campaign generated the lead. And he followed who would receive the lead and the outcome of the lead. So, he could do an ROI on his ad spend. 


The first year I did this for this client, I hated it. All of the paperwork and mapping. Setting up remote call forwarding tracking phone numbers sucked. It took forever on the phone with the phone company. I felt like I was doing a bunch of work the customer should be doing. But I was young and in my ignorance. I thought my job was to create great advertising campaigns to make the phone ring with leads. And it was the customer's job to turn the calls from the advertising into a sale. 


In my second year at the company, they changed the compensation plan. Overnight it changed the game. Advertising results become more important than your sales results. The restauranteur customer I hated doing the extra work for. He was my biggest client this year. It was renewal time. I thought to myself. Watch it be my luck that the client gave me the numbers to keep my job last year. Cancels on me this year, and I get fired because I could not make up for the lost revenue. So, I made him my first appointment; that way, I had time to try and recover if it went sideways and he canceled. I did not have access to the call reporting numbers or the call outcomes the customer did. So the first question I asked was, how do the numbers look? 


Section 2 


After a long pause, he got excited and shared with me the call report. And what he did with the call information. And how the calls were routed to reservations. And when a table was reserved, he used that for verification of sale. Then he shared the average ticket per table and how many times he turned tables throughout the day. He explained that if the servers sold high-profit items. Like desserts or bottled water to 10% of the tables, he would make another 20% return on his advertising. 


He whipped up all the data like his head chief that makes the cioppino his restaurants are famous for. And created what he called his sales machine. He was a six-sigma black belt. And explained that his sales machine came from manufacturing. But instead of manufacturing and having an assembly line where you're creating widgets. You're manufacturing and have an assembly line where you are creating customers. I was hooked at first sight. It was the first time I had seen the sales process visually. 


Then he told me he was making $5.00 for every dollar he spent on advertising. Needless to say, he did not cancel his advertising. There was proof of the results; with that proof from his sales machine. I could sell him the expanded advertising program I had set up. That sale pushed me over the top, and I earned one of the coveted top sales awards that year. And almost every year after that I worked there, all because of my customer’s sales machine.


When I entered the recruitment industry. I used the sales machine I learned from my advertising client. To build my first recruitment company. To over a million dollars in sales in the first six months in business. After a couple of years, I was able to buy my way out of corporate America. And went to work at the recruitment company full-time. 


The first thing I did was go to work adjusting my sales machine. To accommodate the recruitment process. Instead of manufacturing and having an assembly line where you're creating customers. Like the sales machine did. You're manufacturing and have an assembly line where you are creating successful employees and reasons for them to stay. 


I have gone through several different versions of the recruitment engine over the last two decades. I made adjustments dictated by the market conditions. I also improved from what I learned while working on my growth marketing certification from Digital Marketer. If you want to know about digital marketing. I highly recommend Ryan Deiss and the team at Digital Marketer. 


The recruitment engine is how I manufacture and produce qualified candidates. To be hired repeatably and predictively. It is a visual representation of how candidates are created. So, you can reduce the time it takes to fill a position. Streamline the application process. Improve the candidate's experience. So, you lose fewer candidates as they go through the six stages of the recruitment cycle. You can automate repetitive tasks for the recruiter efficiently. To free up time for more critical work. Like getting more of the qualified candidates your recruiter talks to, to your job offer. So, your team has a better chance of making the right job-to-candidate match. And you have a new high-performing employee to add to the team.

Section 3 Growth Marketing 
When you study the success of the world's biggest technology companies, like Facebook, Amazon, Airbnb, Twitter, PayPal, Drobox, Yelp, Instagram and way more than can be listed here, 
They have attributed their success to one thing. That one thing is their skill at creating the network effect. The network effect is the concept that the value of a product. Or service increases when the number of people who use that product or service increases. Their skill at exploiting growth marketing, or growth hacking, to produce network effects. That’s the one skill that enabled them to become market leaders. 


Growth marketers or growth hackers. Are the people who are responsible for all the functions that improve business revenue. This can include everything from acquiring new customers. And turning them into repeat purchasers. And re-engaging the clients that drop out of the sales process. And bring them back to complete the sale, to find new ways to re-engage former clients to buy again. And ways to convert visitors who did not buy to new customers. 


Growth marketing or growth hacking's goal is. Not to achieve linear growth by increasing the workforce. Instead, growth is achieved by removing bottlenecks or friction in your technology. So the user experience is seamless and more candidates make it to your job offer. That produces small wins compounded over time. You are ultimately turning small improvements into landslide competitive advantages. And the more you continue to make small improvements. The more efficient and valuable your recruitment and retention technology becomes. It’s kind of like compounded interest in your retirement account. The longer you do it, the more it multiplies and increases in value. 


This is accomplished by marrying creativity with data analysis, marketing, and messaging. It works because your decisions stay rooted in data. At the same time, you still apply creativity. And curiosity while surveying your candidates. And your talent acquisition team at critical steps of the process. 


Network effects are among the most important reasons you pick one product or service over another. This growth engine technology strategy is moving from sales. And the marketing side of the business. To the recruitment and retention side of the business. I adapted this process to my recruitment and retention technology strategy. Where I created a recruitment engine to identify conversion points. Then, we optimize those conversion points. That turns small improvements in the candidate's experience. Into landslide recruitment advantages, creating network effects. We then run a funnel report through our AI engine for even more ways to improve our results. 


It works through a feedback loop. Small wins compounded over time. Strengthen the recruitment and retention technology. By removing friction and bottlenecks so more canidates make it to your job offer. That produces market-shifting advantages. That is not easy for the competition to knock off. Which is precisely what we are looking for. The outcome is you’re technology is strengthened as improvements are made. So, more of your candidates make it to your job offer. 


Now, just a small 5% improvement in hires every month. Is a massive 80% improvement after a year. Multiply that over the years you are in business, and the advantages are market shifting. The benefits you will have when you do this are not easy for the competition to knock off. Your recruitment engine creates an extra barrier to entry from competitors. Trying to poach your recruitment and retention strategy or, worse… your employees. 


The longer you improve. The less friction or bottlenecks your canidates will experience. And the more attractive your company's employer brand. And recruitment messaging creates even more intrinsic value. Positioning you as the employer of choice. That drives even more candidates toward your job offer. And that only continues your landslide advantage in your talent market. 


The world event that guided our path was the use of growth marketing. According to LinkedIn, Growth is so important right now. The growth marketing manager role is the No. 1 fastest-growing job in Canada and France. In the United States, head of revenue operations (definitely a growth role) tops the list. And three countries — India, Mexico, and the United Kingdom — listed the head of growth or chief growth officer among its top 10, at the time of the writing of this book. 


As you can see, this growth marketing strategy is being adopted in all types of businesses worldwide. It requires a skill set that most people just don’t have. Companies that are not using this growth engine strategy. Are scrambling to hire people who can execute it to grow their company. Why? Because it works. 


This is the human intelligence side of our Hybrid AI for hiring strategy. That is reshaping recruitment and retention. So if you only execute AI and automation tools. Without the human strategy of growth marketing. You will never experience the value of having a network effect. That gives you the advantage in hiring. HR departments are following the lead of enterprise-sized companies. In adapting this strategy with their technology. We are entering a time when we can no longer set up a recruitment technology strategy and forget it again. It is complex, and then you add AI and automation to the mix. Which adds a whole new dimension of complexity; I understand I have been in your shoes. I promise I will make it as simple for you as I can. 






Section 4 Introduce the recruitment engine. 


I bet you have never heard of a recruitment engine. Or know what a recruitment engine is? A recruitment engine is my customer's sales machine strategy. And the growth engine strategy from growth marketing combined. I combined those strategies and created a recruitment engine. It is the documented stages of the candidate's recruitment journey to your job offer. To create a funnel map of all conversion points to the job offer. 


We use the funnel map to document the digital journey to identify friction. And bottlenecks in the stages of the recruitment cycle. Once we have identified the friction and bottlenecks. We will remove them to give a better recruitment experience to your candidates. So fewer of them fall out as they move through the six stages of the recruitment cycle. And more qualified candidates will make it to your job offer. Getting you more hires. And the most significant return for your time, effort, and investment. A recruitment engine is. Also the visual representation of your candidates' journey to your job offer. It starts when a candidate responds to an open job. And ends when the job offer is accepted or denied. Your company's recruitment cycle. 


Your recruitment engine also serves the purpose of the visual representation. We will give the higher-ups to get the project approval. We will use our recruitment engine as evidence to support our claim. To show the benefits of doing the project. And the recruitment engine will also show you the consequences of. Not solving your recruitment and retention problem. It will highlight the parts of the recruitment process that are going well. And the areas that could be going better. To identify bottlenecks and friction causing you to lose qualified candidates. 


We do that with a tool I created, the recruitment cycle success path. The recruitment cycle success path is. The six documented stages of the recruitment cycle. That guides candidates from application to job offer. We use these six stages in the candidate's experience. To make up your company’s recruitment engine. 


You break down each stage of the recruitment cycle into two experiences. The technology experience and the messaging experience. They have different objectives. But overlap and must be congruent to produce high-performing employees. So, let's go ahead with the candidate’s technology experience. And map the bottlenecks and friction. I will be going into some explanation of the messaging strategy to give context. To how all of the moving parts work together. In My next book, Reshaping Recruitment The Transformation of Employer Branding with AI and Advanced Automation, covers my complete messaging strategy. Based on Maslow’s needs theory, our messaging talks to our candidates, not at them.

Embrace the future today! 💪✨ #AI #RecruitmentRevolution,Chapter 1: Navigating the Hiring Highway,"
Over two decades ago, when I first entered the fascinating world of trucking and logistics recruitment, it was a different era. Hiring was a straightforward process back then, perhaps even rudimentary compared to today's standards. The industry was growing, and jobs were plentiful. Looking back, those were the days of simplicity in the hiring landscape.
But as the adage goes, ""Change is the only constant."" The tides of time swirled, and so did the logistics and trucking industry. The big problem was the driver shortage, a persistent thorn in the side of an industry otherwise buzzing with opportunity. It felt like being stranded on a highway with a truck full of promises but no drivers to steer it.
I struggled with this relentless challenge, tirelessly brainstorming strategies to attract and retain the drivers we hired. At times, it seemed like an impossible task. But I wasn't alone. The entire industry was facing the same predicament. We just started the AI revolution, and industries worldwide were turning to technology as their savior. Intrigued and inspired, I contemplated if AI could be our knight in shining armor.
The world event that revolutionized hiring was the adoption of Chat GPT. AI and automation in recruitment and retention processes. It happened slowly at first, but its impact was profound. Companies using AI and automation were beating out companies not using AI and automation. Companies started using AI-powered recruitment systems to automate recruitment workflows and automate communication through omnichannel. They even had ways to inform you how fast your recruitment team returned canidates calls and texts, ensuring the best canidates to application ratio. And no canidates get ghosted, providing a great candidate experience. So more of your qualified candidates make it to your job offer. Giving your team the canidates needed to make the best job-to-candidate match. 
From the shadows of this transformation emerged a glimmer of hope. Could we, too, harness the power of technology to tackle our recruitment woes? The promise was enticing, and the opportunity immense.
In this chapter, we'll traverse the hiring highway, shedding light on traditional hiring methods and exploring the role of technology in modern hiring processes. We'll delve into my personal journey and how my perspective on hiring has evolved. Drawing inspiration from the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" and the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" we'll learn to identify talent and overcome adversity. Buckle up, for an enlightening ride awaits us on the hiring highway.
Section 1 - Analysis of traditional hiring methods in the trucking industry
Steering back to the beginning of my career, hiring in the trucking industry was an art rooted in gut feelings, intuition, and personal judgment. Candidates were assessed primarily based on their ability to handle a truck, commitment to the job, and willingness to spend long hours on the road. They were face-to-face interactions, handshake deals, and decisions made around the coffee table. It was all incredibly human and intensely personal.
The process took time and often hit-or-miss. While we celebrated when we found the right fit, it was back to square one when we didn't. It was incredibly challenging to assess a candidate's commitment, adaptability, and resilience through just an interview or two. Our assessment was based largely on their past driving record and the charm of their personality.
Furthermore, the hiring process was localized. We predominantly relied on local talent pools or word-of-mouth referrals. Our go-to recruitment strategy was placing a help wanted ad in the local newspaper or at the town job fair to fill jobs. In some ways, it was comforting, familiar. But it was also limiting.
This traditional approach began showing its cracks as the industry grew more competitive. Trucking is about more than just driving from point A to point B. It's about adhering to tight schedules, maintaining the vehicle, managing on-road challenges, and ensuring the safe and timely delivery of goods while being a customer service rep. And most importantly, it's about doing all this consistently, day in and day out, while providing a great customer experience. 
These complexities were often overlooked in traditional hiring practices. As a result, we ended up hiring drivers who were good at driving but needed help with the other aspects of the job. The result? High turnover rates and a constant struggle to keep our complete fleet on the road.
As I navigated these challenges, I saw the need for a more robust, comprehensive hiring strategy that considered a candidate’s driving skills and overall suitability for the job. The seeds of change were sown. But what I needed was a game changer, a revolutionary approach that would take our hiring strategy from basic to brilliant.
Section 2 - The Role of Technology in modern hiring processes
The AI (artificial intelligence) Technology revolution began to assert its role in the modern hiring process during this quest for a new approach. Inspired by industries that were seamlessly integrating AI and automation in their hiring practices, I pondered upon its potential in ours.
As we dove deeper into the realm of technology, we discovered a world brimming with possibilities. Candidate Relation Management Systems (CRM) Built on advanced automation platforms. Equipped with AI capabilities were revolutionizing the way hiring was done. 
The sophisticated system had four different advanced automation systems running in the background. To provide your team with the right tools and system to streamline the recruitment processes. It promised recruiter efficiency, accuracy, and a significant reduction in time-to-hire by providing a great candidate experience. 
Moreover, data-driven hiring became a possibility. We could analyze historical data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. AI brought the power of predictive analytics, enabling us to foresee hiring trends, anticipate needs, and strategize accordingly. We could answer critical questions like: What traits do our best drivers share? What makes a driver stay with us for the long term?
Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual reality tools opened avenues for a more engaging candidate experience. Prospective drivers could interact with chatbots to get immediate answers to their queries. Virtual reality could give them a realistic simulation of their job, leading to better-informed decisions.
The role of technology in modern hiring processes extends beyond just finding and hiring the right candidate. It also played a significant part in onboarding and retaining the hired talent. Technology made keeping the drivers engaged and committed easier, from AI-assisted onboarding programs to regular check-ins and feedback loops.
Looking at all these possibilities, I was in awe of how technology could be a game changer. It had the potential to address the very issues we had been struggling with. It was a revolutionary, data-driven, and efficient approach to an age-old problem. As I stood on the brink of this technological revolution, I was convinced that this was the path we needed to tread.
Section 3 - My journey and the evolution of my perspective on hiring
In my journey from just a recruiter to being the top Digital Recruitment and Retention Strategies for the trucking and logistics industry.  I've weathered numerous storms and celebrated countless victories. Each phase offered a learning experience and substantially altered my perspective on hiring.
I started my career when hiring was primarily a personal affair. Hiring is based on a face-to-face interview and a person’s willingness to work hard. It was the age of intuition-based hiring. That's not to say it was flawed - I was a testament to its success. But as I moved up the ladder, I realized it was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.
I remember distinctly, a time in the early stages of my recruitment career when we were struggling with high turnover. We had a team of hard-working drivers, but they weren't staying. The strain of long hours, tight schedules, and road challenges was taking its toll. This was my first brush with the limitations of traditional hiring methods.
I realized then that hiring for the trucking industry needed more than just intuition - it required understanding the complexities of the job and assessing the candidate's capability to handle them. It was about hiring drivers who wouldn't just drive but thrive in the high-pressure, challenging trucking environment of today.
As I wrestled with these challenges, I discovered the potential of technology to transform our hiring process. What initially seemed like a daunting, almost alien concept started making sense. The more I delved into it, the more I saw its potential to streamline our hiring, expand our reach, and drastically improve our success rate.
My journey through the adoption of AI in hiring echoed the broader AI revolution that was transforming industries worldwide. It was a period of rapid evolution and change. Companies that embraced AI and advanced automation were propelling ahead, while those that resisted were falling behind.
In this whirlwind of change, I found inspiration in the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. They advocated a data-driven, structured approach to hiring - a methodology that could potentially revolutionize our hiring process. I also found motivation in the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". The protagonist's resilience, commitment, and relentless pursuit of his dream was a reflection of the kind of drivers we wanted to hire. I was able to harness the power of AI by following the lead from wall street quants. The dynamic world of Wall Street, known for its rapid fortunes made or lost, has seen the game completely changed with the introduction of AI and Quants. 
These influences shaped my perspective, leading me to understand that the key to successful hiring lay in a harmonious blend of technology and human touch. Humanity was becoming the new technology. I realized that while AI and automation could do much of the heavy lifting, the human element was critical in making the final call. After all, it was about finding people who would be the face of our company on the road. 
Section 4 - Learning from the reference book and movie, with a focus on identifying talent and overcoming adversity
I found valuable lessons in ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. The book gave me the tools to chart a course in the tumultuous seas of hiring, particularly as it focused on hiring for attitude and potential. They emphasized how it's not always about the qualifications or experience; it's about who they are as individuals and whether they align with the company's values and culture.
Their concept of the A player - an employee that has at least a 90 percent chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10 percent of possible candidates could achieve - resonated deeply. The A player for us was a driver who not only drove but also represented our company's values, was the face of our company, maintained strong customer relationships, and upheld the highest safety standards.
However, finding these A players required a change in our hiring approach. We needed to look beyond just the driving skills and delve deeper into their attitude, resilience, and potential. We needed a structured, data-driven approach that combined technology and human intuition - the perfect blend of artificial and emotional intelligence. 
This reminded me of how AI gave Wall Street Firms an edge over the competition. However, when AI became widely adopted, this advantage faded. This is where Quants, the heroes of wall street, stepped in. They brought forth a revolutionary approach, Hybrid AI. Where we use the best of human intelligence paired with artificial intelligence. The firms that adopted this approach by the Quants pulled ahead of the competition, redefining the leaders on wall street. 
Wall streets evolution parallels the current state of recruitment and retention. As quants disrupted Wall Street with Hybrid AI, recruitment and retention strategist are becoming the “quants” of HR. We are using Hybrid AI to improve recruitment and retention in the trucking and logistics industry. Where humans make the final decision aided by the data from AI. 
This is where the lessons from the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" came into play. The protagonist, Chris Gardner, was the embodiment of resilience and determination. He was a man with limited resources and opportunities, yet his unyielding determination to provide for his son and pursue his dream job was inspiring.
Gardner was a perfect example of an A player. He didn't have the qualifications or experience, but his attitude and resilience were unmatched. He was the kind of driver we wanted - one who would persist through challenges, remain committed to the job, and continuously strive for excellence.
The movie was a stark reminder that adversities can be overcome with a resilient spirit and a relentless pursuit of happiness. It was a reflection of the challenges our drivers faced - long hours, road hazards, solitude - and yet, with the right attitude and support, they could overcome them.
Bringing these lessons into our hiring process, we reshaped our strategy. We deployed AI tools to screen for skill-based parameters, freeing us to focus on personal traits during interviews. We looked for traits like resilience, determination, and a positive attitude, traits that we had overlooked in our traditional hiring approach.
We started conducting behavioral interviews, posing situational questions to assess how they would react in challenging scenarios. How did they handle a particularly challenging delivery? How did they cope with the solitude on long hauls? How did they deal with difficult customers or situations?
We began to see a change as we integrated these lessons into our hiring process. Our hiring decisions were becoming more informed, our driver pool was strengthening, and our retention rates were improving. We were making headway in our battle with the driver shortage.
Section 5 - Conclusion: Navigating the Road Ahead
The transformation in our recruitment approach was not an overnight occurrence; it was a journey paved with trials, errors, and learnings. However, these changes were essential and long overdue, not just for our company but for the trucking industry as a whole.
The lessons we learned, the improvements we made, and the progress we witnessed were encouraging. We managed to turn the wheels of our recruitment process, steering it away from traditional, limiting hiring practices towards a future defined by innovation, inclusivity, and intelligence. We succeeded in integrating the nuances of our industry, the essence of our drivers, and the power of technology into our hiring process.
Yet, as with any journey, ours is ongoing, and we continue to learn, adapt, and evolve. We are by no means perfect, and the driver shortage problem is far from resolved. But we are better than the competition, and that's what matters.
The AI revolution is reshaping recruitment and retention in the trucking industry, and its adoption is not a matter of” if” but “when.” The driver shortage is a pressing issue that warrants immediate attention and creative solutions. Advanced technology, AI, and automation present themselves as powerful allies in this fight. If you can connect the dots of strategy to use AI and advanced automation for you. 
The integration of technology in our hiring process has offered us insights, solutions, and opportunities we could not have imagined. It has allowed us to explore a wealth of untapped potential and resources that can prove to be game-changers in our industry.
However, technology is only a tool; its successful implementation and impact depend heavily on the user. A hammer in the hands of a child is merely a toy, but in the hands of a sculptor, it can create masterpieces. Similarly, AI and automation can transform the recruitment landscape in our industry, but only if used strategically and wisely.
And in this endeavor, empathy and understanding are our guiding lights. It's about remembering that behind every application and resume is a person with hopes, dreams, fears, and responsibilities. It's about knowing that a driver is not just a worker, but an ambassador of our company, a custodian of our goods, and a crucial link in our economic chain.
I implore other industry leaders, HR professionals, and transport managers to embrace this new dawn, challenge traditional norms, and navigate uncharted territories. The road ahead is uncertain, filled with challenges and opportunities alike. But if we navigate it together, sharing insights, learnings, and best practices, we can shape a future where driver shortages are a thing of the past, and the industry thrives with committed, competent, and content drivers.
Let this chapter serve as an invitation to embark on this transformative journey where technology meets talent acquisition. Remember, it's not about merely surviving the driver shortage but thriving through it.
Action Steps:
1.	Challenge the Norms: Question your existing recruitment practices. Are they effective? Are they limiting your pool of potential drivers?
2.	Adopt Technology: Embrace the use of AI and automation in your hiring process. Use them to streamline processes, broaden your search, and facilitate better decision-making.
3.	Focus on the Person, Not Just the Driver: Look beyond driving skills and qualifications. Assess attitudes, values, and potential. Remember, you're hiring a person, not just a driver.
4.	Learn and Adapt: Stay updated with industry trends, technological advancements, and best practices. Learn from others and be willing to adapt your processes accordingly.
5.	Share Your Insights: Don't keep your learnings to yourself. Share them with others in the industry. Remember, we're in this together.

Studies show quick responses lead to higher success. Prioritize prompt replies to attract top talent and stay ahead! 💼🎯 #RecruitmentTips #HiringStrategies #StayAhead (212 characters),Chapter 3 Speed is what matters.,"I remember like it yesterday. I had landed a giant recruitment contract. But I did not know I was not the only recruitment company with the contract. They also contracted with one of my biggest competitors. 
The big company had more people and more resources, and they were using them to beat me out for all the placements. I was in the fight of my business life. They did not like me being there and were determined to push me out. I needed to make placements, or I would lose the contract, and the big company would win. 

So I decided I would use the shotgun approach. I upped my advertising budget again and did a text message campaign for the candidates that were on my list (candidates I own). It kind of worked, and kind of didn’t work... here is what I mean. The number of candidates that responded to our job posting & text message campaign increased.   

But the number of people we hired only increased for some recruiters and not others. The strange thing I noticed about the results is. I would have 2 recruiters with the same skill set and get two wildly different results from them. You would think the results would be similar to each other. It was frustrating...I suspected that something was up. If I could solve this puzzle, I could easily double my profits with the same number of resources, ad spend, and effort I am using now.  

I started searching for any study, report, or any bit of creditable information on what would cause such a difference in performance with two equally skilled recruiters. I read article after article clicking link after link in the articles for what seemed like weeks until I finally ended up finding a study by Harvard business review. I found a study on sales companies' response rates 
 

Our research shows that most companies are not responding nearly fast enough… our research indicates that many firms are too slow to follow up on these leads. We audited 2,241 U.S. companies…. 24% took more than 24 hours—and 23% of the companies never responded at all. The average response time…. was 42 hours.  
These results are especially shocking given how quickly online leads go cold. Firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times as likely to qualify the lead….as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later—and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer.”’ 
Source: Harvard Business Review 
https://timetoreply.com/harvard-business-review/ 
 
The first time I read the report, I thought it had valuable information. And I put the report in my file to read again. I continued my search, but I could not find anything that useful. A few weeks passed, and I picked up the Harvard business review report to read it again. When I finished reading the report, I came to a different conclusion. Have you ever experienced that? You get a different message from the same report or book on a different read. 

This time reading the report, I realized the variable for success was not the sales skill of the salesperson. The variable for success was the speed at which the salesperson responded to the lead. Only after the salesperson was talking to a prospect did the sales skill come into play. 

I wondered if that was happening with my recruitment team. It would explain the discrepancy between the two recruiters with similar skills. With these market conditions, candidates rule the hiring process. Who knows. First, I needed to know how fast we respond to new candidates. To do that, we had to pull reporting from our phone system. And reporting from our hire-up funnel software and cross reference that will the call report to get the full picture. We broke it down by each recruiter extension and transfer.  

Here is what we uncovered each recruiter handled their new candidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason on how my recruiters responded to the new canidates they received from our advertising.  As we studied the data, a pattern started to emerge. We cross-referenced that with the placements report, and my suspicions were confirmed.  

Some of our recruiters responded to new canidates on the day they applied and they filled a lot more jobs than the recruiters that responded the following day or the following two days. There was a direct correlation between how fast a call, text, or resume was responded to by a recruiter. And the total number of people hired by that recruiter. 

The Harvard Business Review Report proved to ring true in recruiting candidates from the Internet. This means we lost a lot of candidates, which cost a lot of money. And wasted a lot of our recruiter's time following up trying to get these canidates on the phone to qualify. All because we delayed responding to new canidates one day. Is your team doing the same thing?  

Section 1 Ghosting Canidates 

That reminded me of a project we did for a client. They were having all kinds of issues with their hiring. So we did a survey of all the candidates they did not hire, and the results were eye-opening 30% of the candidates said that the recruiter ghosted them. Almost half of the ghosted candidates said it happened more than two times.    
 
This damaged their employer's brand. And can have a negative effect on future candidates from applying. It is critical that candidate ghosting does not happen. And adequate and appropriate feedback given to job seekers. No matter what stage of the hiring process they are in.    
 
Reshaping recruitment and retention is all about human interaction. It is not just about AI or an online experience; it has a human element. So, you must integrate human interaction with technology and AI to achieve the greatest results, hybrid AI. I worked with the team to determine the best way to respond to new candidates from our advertising. After weeks of trial and error. We tested different timelines on hundreds of new candidates from our advertising.   
 
AI crunched the data and showed that if we returned our candidates' first call. Text, application or resume within 15 minutes. We were six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. The team agreed that 15 minutes was a reasonable time to respond. So that became the new business rule.    
 
Section 2 Check & Balance:  

After that experience, I realized I needed a check and balance system. To ensure that my recruiters were treating each and every candidate the same. And the system informs the management team when business processes are not being followed. Or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure you do not miss a hiring deadline. To carry out this. We use check and balance rules in the workflow that could not be possible without automation with decision logic.    
 
Having check and balance rules in Hire up Funnels was an eye-opening experience for me. Before we put our check and balance in the workflow. We had no way to measure how our recruitment team followed up with canidates. Just like most of you.    
 
I did not know how long it took our recruiters to respond to new candidates from our advertising. Or if they were getting ghosted, It was like flying blind. With our check and balance rules. You will know if all your business’s best practices and recruitment rules are followed. Ensuring recruiter efficacy and good candidate experience. like flying with instruments, you know if you are on course or not, so you can correct and get back on track.    
 
Here is how the check and balance rules work. If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. Call a candidate back within 15 min of receiving a new candidate. The check and balance workflow would send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task and e-mail. Ensure a prompt callback and make sure the new candidate is not ghosted.    
 
Suppose this happens two times in a row. And the candidate is not called within the time limit of our business rules. In that case, the workflow sends a notification to the assigned recruitment manager. Who can then figure out why the new candidate. That you spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules. For the highest advertising-to-interview conversion ratio.    
 
Ensuring all candidates get a great experience. You are more productive; you hire more of the qualified candidates you are already talking to. The Hire Up funnels workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate. So, you hire more of the qualified canidates you are already talking to. Never worry if your team is not following best practices and rules. Our check and balance rules will keep you informed.   

After giving our team the information and tools to improve their results. Our team now has an average 5-minute response time to new candidates from our advertising. All recruiters have increased the number of hires. Some so much that you would not believe me if I shared them with you. Check and balance rules can carry out various tasks. We use several versions throughout our Hire Up Funnels.   
 
Section 3 Follow up programmed in check and balance rules.    
 
I wanted to beat the big company for the most placements badly. I dug a little deeper in the data and started to see a new pattern. I shared it with the team, and they confirmed it. When a candidate calls, text, or submit a resume. And if the call went to voicemail or a text was not returned, that started a domino effect of complications. The most time-consuming was the never-ending game of phone tag. To get the candidate back on the phone or respond to your text so you could activate. And start the recruitment process of qualification.    
 
I returned to my Hire up Funnels software and pulled reporting of follow-up attempts. To successful calls where we got the candidate on the phone to do the prescreening call to qualify. And move to the next stage of the recruitment cycle success path. 
 
The results were like the new candidate from advertising results. Every recruiter handled the new canidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason for how many follow-up calls a recruiter made. Everyone on the team had a different number of follow-up calls. We shared the results with the team. The high-performing recruiters made more follow-up calls than the low-performer ones. The report told us that 20% of the team gave up after only two follow-up attempts. That was disappointing...   
 
I shared the results with the team to see the best way to fix this. The recruiters that responded with the least number of follow-up calls. Shared some very valuable information with us. The main reason for not making as many follow-up calls. Was that they felt like they were pestering the candidates. And felt like they were being pushy. I can understand that.    
 
So, the big question was. How many times should candidates be called for the best contact, qualification, and hiring ratios? And so, your team knows the number of calls to make that they are not bothering candidates. So, we tested the candidates we had. To see the correct number of follow-ups. To get a candidate that responded to our job advertisement. On the phone who did not answer the recruiters' first return call.   
 
We tested calling, texting, and sending e-mails, and pixel targeting. It was surprising to learn that you must do much more follow-up than one would think for a job.  But you do not want to overdo it, burn out your candidates, and destroy your reputation in your market. The sweet spot is to be persistent but not a stalker. The stats told us that we needed to follow up seven. To eight times to get a candidate activated on the phone (without upsetting them). To do a prescreen call and qualify.    
 
Digging even deeper into the data. We also discovered that if we did not get the candidate on the phone in the first seven days after applying with us. They went cold and non-responsive. The tests we ran told us we got more people on the phone to prescreen. And qualify if we used a combination of phone calls and text messages, and e-mails.    
 
On a fluke my lead recruiter suggested that we try using our AI chatbot in our follow-up messages. To give our canidates the option to use the AI chatbot to book time to talk to the recruiter, and boy, did they.   
 
Section 4 Follow-up rules.    
 
We added follow-up rules to our check and balance workflow with that data. When the recruiter calls the new candidate back, the call is unanswered. We have a control requiring eight follow-ups for every new candidate not activated. The recruiter calls the candidate every other day for eight days. When the recruiter does not call. We set up the workflow to send our omnichannel communication.    
 
This way, we reach out to our candidate eight times in six days. With four calls from the recruiter and four automated Omni channel communication. Including AI chatbots, to schedule a call with a recruiter. Increasing the efficiency of our recruitment team. Getting more people on the phone. And into the qualification stage of the recruitment cycle.    
 
If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. The workflow would automatically send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task in their calendar and e-mail. If your recruiter does not adhere to the follow-up rules. Another reminder task is sent if this happens twice in a row. The candidate is not called within the time frame of our business rules. Then the workflow sends a notification. To the assigned recruitment manager. Who can figure out why the new candidate. That we spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules time frame.    
 
 
Ensure all candidates have a great recruitment experience. And we are more productive, so we hire more of the qualified candidates we are already talking to. The recruitment funnel workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate.  
 
Section 5 Conclusion 
 
Here is how important a good candidate's experience is. According to career plug. 80% of candidates said that a positive candidate experience influenced their decision to say yes to an offer. 58% of job seekers said that a poor candidate experience led them to decline a job.    
https://www.careerplug.com/blog/improve-hiring-with-better-communication/  
 
So, I adjusted my funnel with the check and balance rules of 15 min to return a call. And programed eight follow ups for every new candidate and relaunched it. Did some optimization and the team started to hire more people. We started to beat the big company for placements. With the same resources I was spending before I made the changes to the check and balance rules. It was an all-out war for the top spot. One week they would take the top spot, and the next week, we would take the top spot. This went on for several weeks, the competition was fierce. It was technology strategy versus strength, who would win?    
 
With a dedicated team and the right tools. We were able to track, measure and optimize our recruitment funnels. To become number one, we held the top spot to the end of the recruitment contract. Technology strategy wins over strength every time...    
 
Success is achieved by adjusting technology. To accommodate human behavior opened a whole new world for me. What else can I do to gain market advantage? So, I studied the biggest technology companies. To figure out how they grew so fast and became market leaders.   
 
Remember, there is something much bigger at play here than just data. As the data increases and the metrics become more trackable, It is easy to get sucked into the analytics of it all. And in the process, forget that there is a person on the other side of the metrics. A person with a problem, a person who needs you to solve their problem.

Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation?

I know this first-hand. I've witnessed the rise and fall of many promising companies in the logistics industry. As a passionate observer and participant in this industry's grand tapestry. I learned the most crucial lesson: the power of innovation. But there's a particular kind of innovation that I've found to be the game-changer in today's world. This story is about how AI breathed new life. Into my company's recruitment and retention process and revolutionized our competitive edge. It can do the same for you, too.


A few years back, my reputable truck driver recruiting company was grappling with a crippling problem. – The driver shortage and the lack of qualified drivers. Like a nagging toothache that wouldn't relent. Our hiring crisis was slowly, yet assuredly, gnawing at the company's foundation. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages. The open positions remained unfilled, and the retention rate was abysmal. The situation peaked when we lost a key client due to a talent shortage. This was the wake-up call.


Determined to turn the tide. We embraced the innovation shaking the core of several industries: Artificial Intelligence. We invested in an AI-powered recruiter system. A decision met with skepticism and resistance. The transition was challenging, but as the saying goes. ""Necessity is the mother of invention.""


In time, our AI-powered recruiter hiring system started churning out incredible results. It was an era of transformation. Our ability to identify, attract, and retain qualified drivers improved . The AI system's ability to analyze vast amounts of data. And pinpoint potential candidates was nothing short of remarkable. It was as if we had found the Rosetta Stone of recruitment.

But it wasn't the results that were astounding. Our competition started noticing our incredible turnaround. We were no longer losing bids to our competitors due to a lack of talent. Instead, we were winning new clients because of our innovative approach to recruitment. Word spread about our results, and I had to create a waiting list with many service requests. 


This transformative journey of my company is not an isolated tale. It's part of a much bigger narrative. The ongoing AI revolution sweeping across every nook and cranny of the business world from Wall Street to Main Street. You might remember the movie ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,"" where Jake. An ambitious young trader, seeks to navigate the ruthless world of high-stakes finance. A world constantly reinvented by disruptive technologies. Much like our world today. The movie illustrates the relentless pursuit of a competitive edge in this modern age. An advantage that can often be found in the embrace of AI-powered recruiter.

Attracting, recruiting, and retaining qualified talent is a constant struggle. The stakes are high, and the consequences of losing the battle are devastating. Failed commitments, lost clients, dwindling reputation. And , a significant blow to the bottom line. Traditional recruitment methods, though reliable. Have started to show their age in the face of this increasing competition and complexity. In the throes of this challenge, AI comes in like a knight in shining armor.

We explored its functionalities to understand the competitive edge AI provides. The AI-powered recruiter hiring system. We created was not a fancy high-tech gadget. It was a potent collection of proven systems and processes. Enhanced by AI tools that transformed how we approached recruitment. This data-driven approach resulted in a dramatic improvement in. The quality of our hires. The days of haphazardly recruiting in the talent pool were over. With AI, we had 

Moreover, AI helped us identify patterns and trends. That would have otherwise gone unnoticed. We could track a candidate's digital footprint, online behavior. And engagement with our company's digital platform. As they move through the stages of the recruitment cycle to your job offer. This wealth of information enabled us to. Target potential hires more accurately and craft personalized recruitment messages. Gone were the days of one-size-fits-all approaches. AI ushered us into the era of personalized recruitment.


Furthermore, the speed and efficiency of AI-powered recruiter is awe-inspiring. AI was a tireless worker, unbounded by the limits of human capacity.

This efficiency resulted in significant time and cost savings.


Yet, the most remarkable aspect of AI was its ability to learn and adapt. With every interaction and piece of data it processed. The AI-powered recruiter system became more intelligent and insightful. It constantly learned, evolved, and became more attuned to our company's recruitment metrics. This meant that our recruitment strategy was not static but dynamic. Constantly improving with every new hire.


The benefits of AI in recruitment are not confined to my personal experience. Or the borders of my company. Many businesses across the spectrum, big and small. Have found a competitive edge in AI-powered recruitment. 


Section 2: Samuel's Experience Outperforming Competitors with AI


Samuel (not his real name), the owner of a thriving logistics company. Is no stranger to the intense competition in the transportation industry. The fight to recruite skilled drivers and retain them became fiercer each year. Samuel, a forward-thinking entrepreneur, wasn’t one to shy away from innovation.

We would run each funnel through our recruitment engine. And provide an analysis of the drivers we ran through it with a funnel report. The AI processed vast amounts of data. Including every conversion point in the recruitment cycle, searching for improvement areas. It recognized patterns, creating recommendations for the highest impact. 


The results were nothing short of phenomenal. The number of new drivers hired in the initial months saw an uptick. More, these drivers stayed and became part of the company’s fabric. The AI-powered recruiter hiring system. Had not just recruited drivers; it had recruited commitment.


When Samuel looked at his numbers, he could hardly believe it. His truck driver turnover had reduced , and he had a stable, reliable team of drivers, the best he had in years. But the benefits extended beyond his company. With a dedicated team, Samuel could get off the treadmill. Of putting out fires because of labor shortages, make promises to his clients, and keep them. His reputation in the market soared, and his business saw robust growth.


Meanwhile, his competitors continued their struggle. They used traditional recruitment methods, their processes were slower. Their hires hit-or-miss, and their turnover was high. They couldn't match Samuel’s company’s reliability and lost ground.

Section 3: Lessons from the Reference Book aAnd Movie. Focusing on the Relentless Pursuit of Competitive Advantage in the Modern Age


As we delve into the world of AI in recruitment, two compelling references provide valuable insights. The book ""Competing in the Age of AI"". By Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani and the movie ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.” The lessons they impart echo the experiences shared thus far. Further solidifying the importance of adopting AI in modern-day recruitment.


""Competing in the Age of AI"" offers a profound exploration of AI's transformative impact on businesses and industries. Iansiti and Lakhani's discourse resonates with our exploration of AI in recruitment. They emphasize how firms can leverage AI to transform their operations. Giving them a critical competitive advantage. They talk about 'digital operating models' and the 'AI factory,’. Concepts synonymous with recruitment funnels and the efficiency we've seen in AI-powered recruitment.


The authors describe the AI factory as a system. That utilizes vast amounts of data to produce predictions, insights nd better decisions. Almost identical to the processes we've seen in AI-powered recruiter. This 'factory' doesn't just deliver results. It learns and improves, refining its processes and predictions with every cycle. Iansiti and Lakhani's depiction of the AI factory parallels our experience with AI in our recruitment engine. 


Turning to ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,. One quote by the character Gordon Gekko stands out: ""The mother of all evil is speculation."" While Gekko's context was the volatile world of finance. This statement has significance for us, too. In traditional recruitment, there's a lot of speculation. Will this candidate be a good fit? Will they stay long-term? Such speculation often leads to mistakes, missed opportunities. And, , a loss of time and resources.


AI-powered recruiter reduces such speculation. Analyzing vast amounts of data and recognizing patterns can make well-informed predictions. About a candidate's suitability and likelihood to stay, minimizing uncertainty and speculation. It brings a degree of certainty and predictability. That traditional recruitment methods can't match. Echoing Gekko's sentiment about the perils of speculation.


In the relentless pursuit of competitive advantage, businesses can't afford to ignore AI. AI isn't just a fancy tech tool. Iit's a transformational force that can redefine business operations. Especially in recruitment and retention. Whether we turn to literature, cinema, or our experiences, the message is clear: AI is a game-changer.

Join us on this transformative journey and discover the limitless possibilities that await you. Don't wait, start today! #DataDrivenRecruitment ",Introduction,"Picture this: A time in the not-so-distant future where job applications are screened, shortlisted, interviewed, and hired, not by human beings, but by artificial intelligence. Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

Discover how these technologies enhance hiring efficiency, ensuring a smoother process for companies. 📈✅ #AI #automation #trucking #efficiency",Chapter 1: Navigating the Hiring Highway,"
Over two decades ago, when I first entered the fascinating world of trucking and logistics recruitment, it was a different era. Hiring was a straightforward process back then, perhaps even rudimentary compared to today's standards. The industry was growing, and jobs were plentiful. Looking back, those were the days of simplicity in the hiring landscape.
But as the adage goes, ""Change is the only constant."" The tides of time swirled, and so did the logistics and trucking industry. The big problem was the driver shortage, a persistent thorn in the side of an industry otherwise buzzing with opportunity. It felt like being stranded on a highway with a truck full of promises but no drivers to steer it.
I struggled with this relentless challenge, tirelessly brainstorming strategies to attract and retain the drivers we hired. At times, it seemed like an impossible task. But I wasn't alone. The entire industry was facing the same predicament. We just started the AI revolution, and industries worldwide were turning to technology as their savior. Intrigued and inspired, I contemplated if AI could be our knight in shining armor.
The world event that revolutionized hiring was the adoption of Chat GPT. AI and automation in recruitment and retention processes. It happened slowly at first, but its impact was profound. Companies using AI and automation were beating out companies not using AI and automation. Companies started using AI-powered recruitment systems to automate recruitment workflows and automate communication through omnichannel. They even had ways to inform you how fast your recruitment team returned canidates calls and texts, ensuring the best canidates to application ratio. And no canidates get ghosted, providing a great candidate experience. So more of your qualified candidates make it to your job offer. Giving your team the canidates needed to make the best job-to-candidate match. 
From the shadows of this transformation emerged a glimmer of hope. Could we, too, harness the power of technology to tackle our recruitment woes? The promise was enticing, and the opportunity immense.
In this chapter, we'll traverse the hiring highway, shedding light on traditional hiring methods and exploring the role of technology in modern hiring processes. We'll delve into my personal journey and how my perspective on hiring has evolved. Drawing inspiration from the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" and the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" we'll learn to identify talent and overcome adversity. Buckle up, for an enlightening ride awaits us on the hiring highway.
Section 1 - Analysis of traditional hiring methods in the trucking industry
Steering back to the beginning of my career, hiring in the trucking industry was an art rooted in gut feelings, intuition, and personal judgment. Candidates were assessed primarily based on their ability to handle a truck, commitment to the job, and willingness to spend long hours on the road. They were face-to-face interactions, handshake deals, and decisions made around the coffee table. It was all incredibly human and intensely personal.
The process took time and often hit-or-miss. While we celebrated when we found the right fit, it was back to square one when we didn't. It was incredibly challenging to assess a candidate's commitment, adaptability, and resilience through just an interview or two. Our assessment was based largely on their past driving record and the charm of their personality.
Furthermore, the hiring process was localized. We predominantly relied on local talent pools or word-of-mouth referrals. Our go-to recruitment strategy was placing a help wanted ad in the local newspaper or at the town job fair to fill jobs. In some ways, it was comforting, familiar. But it was also limiting.
This traditional approach began showing its cracks as the industry grew more competitive. Trucking is about more than just driving from point A to point B. It's about adhering to tight schedules, maintaining the vehicle, managing on-road challenges, and ensuring the safe and timely delivery of goods while being a customer service rep. And most importantly, it's about doing all this consistently, day in and day out, while providing a great customer experience. 
These complexities were often overlooked in traditional hiring practices. As a result, we ended up hiring drivers who were good at driving but needed help with the other aspects of the job. The result? High turnover rates and a constant struggle to keep our complete fleet on the road.
As I navigated these challenges, I saw the need for a more robust, comprehensive hiring strategy that considered a candidate’s driving skills and overall suitability for the job. The seeds of change were sown. But what I needed was a game changer, a revolutionary approach that would take our hiring strategy from basic to brilliant.
Section 2 - The Role of Technology in modern hiring processes
The AI (artificial intelligence) Technology revolution began to assert its role in the modern hiring process during this quest for a new approach. Inspired by industries that were seamlessly integrating AI and automation in their hiring practices, I pondered upon its potential in ours.
As we dove deeper into the realm of technology, we discovered a world brimming with possibilities. Candidate Relation Management Systems (CRM) Built on advanced automation platforms. Equipped with AI capabilities were revolutionizing the way hiring was done. 
The sophisticated system had four different advanced automation systems running in the background. To provide your team with the right tools and system to streamline the recruitment processes. It promised recruiter efficiency, accuracy, and a significant reduction in time-to-hire by providing a great candidate experience. 
Moreover, data-driven hiring became a possibility. We could analyze historical data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. AI brought the power of predictive analytics, enabling us to foresee hiring trends, anticipate needs, and strategize accordingly. We could answer critical questions like: What traits do our best drivers share? What makes a driver stay with us for the long term?
Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual reality tools opened avenues for a more engaging candidate experience. Prospective drivers could interact with chatbots to get immediate answers to their queries. Virtual reality could give them a realistic simulation of their job, leading to better-informed decisions.
The role of technology in modern hiring processes extends beyond just finding and hiring the right candidate. It also played a significant part in onboarding and retaining the hired talent. Technology made keeping the drivers engaged and committed easier, from AI-assisted onboarding programs to regular check-ins and feedback loops.
Looking at all these possibilities, I was in awe of how technology could be a game changer. It had the potential to address the very issues we had been struggling with. It was a revolutionary, data-driven, and efficient approach to an age-old problem. As I stood on the brink of this technological revolution, I was convinced that this was the path we needed to tread.
Section 3 - My journey and the evolution of my perspective on hiring
In my journey from just a recruiter to being the top Digital Recruitment and Retention Strategies for the trucking and logistics industry.  I've weathered numerous storms and celebrated countless victories. Each phase offered a learning experience and substantially altered my perspective on hiring.
I started my career when hiring was primarily a personal affair. Hiring is based on a face-to-face interview and a person’s willingness to work hard. It was the age of intuition-based hiring. That's not to say it was flawed - I was a testament to its success. But as I moved up the ladder, I realized it was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.
I remember distinctly, a time in the early stages of my recruitment career when we were struggling with high turnover. We had a team of hard-working drivers, but they weren't staying. The strain of long hours, tight schedules, and road challenges was taking its toll. This was my first brush with the limitations of traditional hiring methods.
I realized then that hiring for the trucking industry needed more than just intuition - it required understanding the complexities of the job and assessing the candidate's capability to handle them. It was about hiring drivers who wouldn't just drive but thrive in the high-pressure, challenging trucking environment of today.
As I wrestled with these challenges, I discovered the potential of technology to transform our hiring process. What initially seemed like a daunting, almost alien concept started making sense. The more I delved into it, the more I saw its potential to streamline our hiring, expand our reach, and drastically improve our success rate.
My journey through the adoption of AI in hiring echoed the broader AI revolution that was transforming industries worldwide. It was a period of rapid evolution and change. Companies that embraced AI and advanced automation were propelling ahead, while those that resisted were falling behind.
In this whirlwind of change, I found inspiration in the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. They advocated a data-driven, structured approach to hiring - a methodology that could potentially revolutionize our hiring process. I also found motivation in the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". The protagonist's resilience, commitment, and relentless pursuit of his dream was a reflection of the kind of drivers we wanted to hire. I was able to harness the power of AI by following the lead from wall street quants. The dynamic world of Wall Street, known for its rapid fortunes made or lost, has seen the game completely changed with the introduction of AI and Quants. 
These influences shaped my perspective, leading me to understand that the key to successful hiring lay in a harmonious blend of technology and human touch. Humanity was becoming the new technology. I realized that while AI and automation could do much of the heavy lifting, the human element was critical in making the final call. After all, it was about finding people who would be the face of our company on the road. 
Section 4 - Learning from the reference book and movie, with a focus on identifying talent and overcoming adversity
I found valuable lessons in ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. The book gave me the tools to chart a course in the tumultuous seas of hiring, particularly as it focused on hiring for attitude and potential. They emphasized how it's not always about the qualifications or experience; it's about who they are as individuals and whether they align with the company's values and culture.
Their concept of the A player - an employee that has at least a 90 percent chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10 percent of possible candidates could achieve - resonated deeply. The A player for us was a driver who not only drove but also represented our company's values, was the face of our company, maintained strong customer relationships, and upheld the highest safety standards.
However, finding these A players required a change in our hiring approach. We needed to look beyond just the driving skills and delve deeper into their attitude, resilience, and potential. We needed a structured, data-driven approach that combined technology and human intuition - the perfect blend of artificial and emotional intelligence. 
This reminded me of how AI gave Wall Street Firms an edge over the competition. However, when AI became widely adopted, this advantage faded. This is where Quants, the heroes of wall street, stepped in. They brought forth a revolutionary approach, Hybrid AI. Where we use the best of human intelligence paired with artificial intelligence. The firms that adopted this approach by the Quants pulled ahead of the competition, redefining the leaders on wall street. 
Wall streets evolution parallels the current state of recruitment and retention. As quants disrupted Wall Street with Hybrid AI, recruitment and retention strategist are becoming the “quants” of HR. We are using Hybrid AI to improve recruitment and retention in the trucking and logistics industry. Where humans make the final decision aided by the data from AI. 
This is where the lessons from the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" came into play. The protagonist, Chris Gardner, was the embodiment of resilience and determination. He was a man with limited resources and opportunities, yet his unyielding determination to provide for his son and pursue his dream job was inspiring.
Gardner was a perfect example of an A player. He didn't have the qualifications or experience, but his attitude and resilience were unmatched. He was the kind of driver we wanted - one who would persist through challenges, remain committed to the job, and continuously strive for excellence.
The movie was a stark reminder that adversities can be overcome with a resilient spirit and a relentless pursuit of happiness. It was a reflection of the challenges our drivers faced - long hours, road hazards, solitude - and yet, with the right attitude and support, they could overcome them.
Bringing these lessons into our hiring process, we reshaped our strategy. We deployed AI tools to screen for skill-based parameters, freeing us to focus on personal traits during interviews. We looked for traits like resilience, determination, and a positive attitude, traits that we had overlooked in our traditional hiring approach.
We started conducting behavioral interviews, posing situational questions to assess how they would react in challenging scenarios. How did they handle a particularly challenging delivery? How did they cope with the solitude on long hauls? How did they deal with difficult customers or situations?
We began to see a change as we integrated these lessons into our hiring process. Our hiring decisions were becoming more informed, our driver pool was strengthening, and our retention rates were improving. We were making headway in our battle with the driver shortage.
Section 5 - Conclusion: Navigating the Road Ahead
The transformation in our recruitment approach was not an overnight occurrence; it was a journey paved with trials, errors, and learnings. However, these changes were essential and long overdue, not just for our company but for the trucking industry as a whole.
The lessons we learned, the improvements we made, and the progress we witnessed were encouraging. We managed to turn the wheels of our recruitment process, steering it away from traditional, limiting hiring practices towards a future defined by innovation, inclusivity, and intelligence. We succeeded in integrating the nuances of our industry, the essence of our drivers, and the power of technology into our hiring process.
Yet, as with any journey, ours is ongoing, and we continue to learn, adapt, and evolve. We are by no means perfect, and the driver shortage problem is far from resolved. But we are better than the competition, and that's what matters.
The AI revolution is reshaping recruitment and retention in the trucking industry, and its adoption is not a matter of” if” but “when.” The driver shortage is a pressing issue that warrants immediate attention and creative solutions. Advanced technology, AI, and automation present themselves as powerful allies in this fight. If you can connect the dots of strategy to use AI and advanced automation for you. 
The integration of technology in our hiring process has offered us insights, solutions, and opportunities we could not have imagined. It has allowed us to explore a wealth of untapped potential and resources that can prove to be game-changers in our industry.
However, technology is only a tool; its successful implementation and impact depend heavily on the user. A hammer in the hands of a child is merely a toy, but in the hands of a sculptor, it can create masterpieces. Similarly, AI and automation can transform the recruitment landscape in our industry, but only if used strategically and wisely.
And in this endeavor, empathy and understanding are our guiding lights. It's about remembering that behind every application and resume is a person with hopes, dreams, fears, and responsibilities. It's about knowing that a driver is not just a worker, but an ambassador of our company, a custodian of our goods, and a crucial link in our economic chain.
I implore other industry leaders, HR professionals, and transport managers to embrace this new dawn, challenge traditional norms, and navigate uncharted territories. The road ahead is uncertain, filled with challenges and opportunities alike. But if we navigate it together, sharing insights, learnings, and best practices, we can shape a future where driver shortages are a thing of the past, and the industry thrives with committed, competent, and content drivers.
Let this chapter serve as an invitation to embark on this transformative journey where technology meets talent acquisition. Remember, it's not about merely surviving the driver shortage but thriving through it.
Action Steps:
1.	Challenge the Norms: Question your existing recruitment practices. Are they effective? Are they limiting your pool of potential drivers?
2.	Adopt Technology: Embrace the use of AI and automation in your hiring process. Use them to streamline processes, broaden your search, and facilitate better decision-making.
3.	Focus on the Person, Not Just the Driver: Look beyond driving skills and qualifications. Assess attitudes, values, and potential. Remember, you're hiring a person, not just a driver.
4.	Learn and Adapt: Stay updated with industry trends, technological advancements, and best practices. Learn from others and be willing to adapt your processes accordingly.
5.	Share Your Insights: Don't keep your learnings to yourself. Share them with others in the industry. Remember, we're in this together.

Most of you might be thinking how do you even write a book? You might be wondering or perhaps you are unsure how to even begin writing your very own bestselling book. But do not worry—we've got you covered. We've got your back with the 96 Hour Book Challenge. 

What you need to do is to take the 96 Hour Book Challenge, and you'll be on your way.

WE USE AI!!!!!


Although I just want you to remember, technology, especially AI, should never be a shortcut—it should be an enhancer. 

You wouldn't want a steak cooked in the microwave for three minutes, would you? So, let's slow-cook your success on the grill, infusing it with the steak butter, rosemary and thyme we need for all the flavors of your raw resources.

Remember, ALWAYS START with the end in mind. 

So who is this book for?

If you're a speaker, coach, author, or thought leader feeling underappreciated and unseen in the market, this book is for you.

Most people don't have the success that they want. That is because they are not fit, they are not millionaire fit. Just like how you get fit in the gym, you can also become a millionaire fit…

Notice that I didn't say, what's in your bank account, what certification you have or a PhD, the history of your family, what house you're in, or what car you drive… NONE OF THAT SHIT MATTERS. You only need to harness the power of your raw resources.

I can share with you that I've sold $20,000 programs with just a Google doc and a Stripe link, all because I knew one thing: how to harness my raw resources.

What do I mean by being R.A.W.? 

Real Transparency

And data, serves as a testament to the power of this technology. These companies became juggernauts in their respective industries. Embracing disruptive technologies and creating network effects, which redefined what's possible

This chapter will guide you through implementing AI-powered strategies in your recruitment process. We will explore the steps to incorporate AI. Address the resistance and challenges you might face. And share insights from my experience with AI-powered recruiter. We'll draw lessons from ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" by Clayton M. Christensen. And references from ""The Social Network"" as guiding lights in this journey.


The opportunities AI presents in the world of recruitment and retention are immense. Whether you are a seasoned industry veteran or a newcomer. The time is now to harness the power of AI. And advanced automation in your recruitment strategies. Prepare to embark on an exciting journey. And brace yourself for the transformative power of AI!


Section 1: Steps to Incorporate AI in Your Recruitment Process


The landscape was somewhat uncharted and complex. When we first dipped our toes into AI-powered recruitment. But, we soon realized that the implementation process could be broken down into manageable steps. So, we created a system and process. To effectively incorporate AI into our recruitment strategy.


Step 1: Understand the Technology


The first step is understanding AI comprehensively and how it applies to recruitment. AI is an umbrella term that includes various technologies. Such as machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. It was crucial to understand these technologies. And connect the dots on how they could enhance our recruitment process. We found that AI could automate repetitive tasks, analyze massive data sets. And help us improve our technology experience. Delivering more canidates to our job offer. Creating network effects, which were invaluable to our recruitment strategy.


Step 2: Identify the Areas of Application


Once we had grasped the fundamentals of AI, we needed to pinpoint where it could make the most impact. Without putting our business at risk. We have data security concerns and algorithm biases to contend with. We use AI to analyze our recruitment cycle and identify bottlenecks and friction. Our AI implementation began with automation and personalization of simple tasks. Like text and email communication and scheduling interviews. We expanded its use to include employer brand messaging. Creating our emplpoy value propresition, workflow process automation. Our co-piolet, and data analysis of each of our recruitment funnels for optimization. After gathering enough data. We would expand our KPIs then create. Different relationships between them for maximum efficiency. You are welcome to adopt our hybrid AI for hiring as your ethical use of AI. All this and much more can be done without the risk of being sued or any bias in any algorithm. 


Step 3: Choose the Right Tools


Many AI tools are available in the market, each promising to revolutionize recruitment. We evaluated numerous tools, considering their capabilities. Compatibility with our existing systems, ease of use. And their ability to align with our specific needs. The right tool for your organization would depend on. Your unique requirements, budget, and technical resources. 


Step 4: Develop an Implementation Plan


With a clear understanding of AI and the right tools at our disposal. We proceeded to develop a comprehensive implementation plan. This plan included objectives, timelines, responsibilities, and contingency measures. We also identified key metrics to gauge the effectiveness of our AI-powered recruitment process. 


Step 5: Training and Adoption


Implementing AI is not merely about deploying new technology. It involves changing how we work. To ensure a smooth transition, we invested in training our staff. Familiarizing them with the latest tools. And helping them understand the benefits of AI. Moreover, we fostered a culture that embraced change and innovation. 


Step 6: Continuous Evaluation and Adjustment


AI is not a one-time solution; it requires continuous evaluation and adjustment. Post-implementation, we regularly reviewed the effectiveness of our AI-powered strategies. Adjusting and fine-tuning as necessary to optimize results.


Implementing AI in our recruitment process was like navigating a ship through uncharted waters. We faced our share of storms and unforeseen obstacles. Yet, the rewards we reap far outweigh the challenges. Our success in implementing AI-powered recruiter marked. A new era in our recruitment and retention strategy. Echoing the sentiments of Mark Zuckerberg in ""The Social Network,"" when he said. ""The internet is not written in pencil, it's written in ink."" Our venture into AI was no different—it was a decisive step forward. A mark indelibly etched into our company's journey.


Section 2: Overcoming Resistance and Challenges During Implementation


While rewarding, the transition to AI-powered recruiter wasn't devoid of challenges and resistance. People are generally resistant to change. Especially when it involves disrupting their traditional ways of working. However, as Clayton M. Christensen illustrates in his book, ""The Innovator's Dilemma,"". It is precisely this sort of disruptive innovation that can lead to significant growth and success.


Fear of being replaced. 


One of the first challenges we faced was the fear of the unknown. Many of our team members, especially those unfamiliar with technology. Were apprehensive about introducing AI. They feared it would render their roles redundant. Or complicate their workflow. To ease these fears, we created our hybrid AI where humanity is the new techonology. Our way of doing business with AI. We ensured our staff was adequately informed about the purpose. And benefits of the AI implementation. We underscored that AI was a tool for them to augment their capabilities. And make them more efficient, not replace them. But make them more valuable to the company. 


Next, we encountered skepticism. Some questioned the reliability of AI. Expressing doubts about its ability to replicate the human touch in recruitment. As part of our Hybrid AI were humanity is tghe new techionology. We addressed these concerns by. Demonstrating the efficacy of hybrid AI through small, successful pilot projects. As the team experienced how humans controlled the AI. The benefits of AI to them became evident, and the skepticism waned.


Resistance also arose from the financial aspect. There was apprehension about the cost of investing in AI technologies. With some viewing it as a potential financial risk. We explained that while AI might need an upfront investment. The long-term gains in efficiency, accuracy, and cost-saving far outweigh the initial outlay.


To ensure that the transition to AI was smooth, we invested in training. We realized that for AI to be effective, our staff needed to understand how to use it effectively. Hence, training was a critical part of our implementation plan.


But, these challenges were not insurmountable. Much like Eduardo Saverin and Mark Zuckerberg's journey in ""The Social Network,."" We had to persist through difficulties and face adversity head-on to realize our vision. Their persistence led to the creating a social media giant. And our tenacity led to a revolution in our recruitment process.


Looking back, the decision to implement AI in our recruitment process was much like a chess game. We had to plan our moves carefully, anticipate the challenges. And adapt our strategies accordingly. But the results were worth the effort. As we effectively countered the resistance and overcame the challenges. We set the stage for a recruitment process that was more efficient, precise, and future-ready.


Section 3: Our First Success with AI-powered Recruiter


After successfully navigating the turbulent waters of implementing AI. We were eager to see the fruits of our labor. Our first major test came in the form of an extensive recruitment drive for a new client we had just secured.


The challenge was immense. They needed experienced. Reliable drivers who could withstand the grueling demands of LTL deliveries. Traditionally, a recruitment drive of this scale. Would have required countless hours of manual work. Sorting through hundreds of applications, scheduling interviews, conducting background checks, and more. But with our AI-powered recruiter in place. We were ready to tackle this task more efficiently than ever.


Our AI system began by contacting hundreds of applications. This task alone saved us many hours. That would have been spent manually calling or texting each resume. Next, one of our recruitment funnels took on. The task of activating them and scheduling interviews. 


It was a smooth and efficient process, but the real success story was yet to come. Out of the sea of candidates that AI had activated. There was one who stood out. Jake Harrison, an experienced driver with an impeccable track record. The system had recognized his potential, and we agreed. Jake was offered the job and accepted.


Jake's performance in the ensuing months was nothing short of exceptional. He proved to be reliable and efficient and demonstrated an impressive work ethic. The system saved us time in recruitment and found us a gem in Jake.


It was this early success story that genuinely. Cemented our belief in AI-powered recruitment. Seeing the tangible impact of our AI implementation. In the form of a successful hire was exhilarating. It was as if we had found a secret weapon. A tool that could propel us ahead in the challenging world of truck driver recruitment.


The story of our first success with AI-powered recruiter. Reminds me of a pivotal scene in ""The Social Network."" After hours of tireless work, the Facebook team launches the website. Watches the user count grow, and realizes they've built something truly transformative. Our moment of realization came when we saw how AI could. Streamline our recruitment process and lead us to excellent hires like Jake. It was a taste of what was possible, a glimpse into the future of AI-powered recruitment.


Jake's success story was just the beginning. As we honed our AI-powered recruiter. We continued to attract and hire highly qualified drivers. Our recruitment process was revolutionized. Saving us precious time and resources and significantly improving our hiring quality.


Section 4: Lessons from the Reference Book. And Movie, Focusing on Embracing Disruptive Technologies


There is a crucial lesson we can draw from our AI-powered recruiter implementation journey. A lesson mirrored by two stories - one from the business world and the other from the realm of popular cinema. Clayton M. Christensen's ""The Innovator's Dilemma"". And the film ""The Social Network"" both underscore. The importance of embracing disruptive technologies.


In ""The Innovator's Dilemma,"". Christensen analyzes why leading companies often fail when confronted with disruptive technologies. Even when they're well-managed and attuned to their markets. These companies, Christensen posits. Place too much emphasis on satisfying customers' current needs. While neglecting new technologies that could meet their unanticipated needs. He emphasizes that to innovate truly. One must be willing to disrupt even successful business models. Embracing novel technologies and practices.


Our AI recruitment strategy mirrored this ethos. While our conventional recruiting methods weren't failing per se. They were labor-intensive and not scalable for the future. Adopting the AI-powered recruiter allowed us. To meet our immediate recruitment needs more efficiently. And created a framework for meeting future challenges we hadn't envisioned.


Similarly, ""The Social Network"" offers a powerful narrative. About how disruptive technologies can revolutionize an industry. The film chronicles the rise of Facebook. A platform that profoundly disrupted how we socialize and communicate. Like Facebook, our AI implementation didn't merely improve upon. Our existing system and processes – it created a new paradigm. For recruitment in the trucking industry.


A pivotal scene in the movie reveals a crucial lesson. As the user count on Facebook continues to rise. A young Mark Zuckerberg resists the idea of monetizing the platform with ads. Arguing that it would disrupt the user experience. Despite financial pressures, he insists on perfecting the platform first. Similarly, during our AI transition, we faced rkunderstood the value of getting it right. The focus was on perfecting the AI implementation. And fine-tuning the system until it was ready to deliver the results we aimed for.


These stories, one from academia. And the other from Hollywood, echo a similar sentiment. They serve as powerful reminders that embracing disruptive technologies. Albeit challenging, is often the key to extraordinary innovation and success. Like the tech giants of Silicon Valley, we, too. Had disrupted our traditional recruitment methods with AI. And in doing so, we set the stage for a future of more efficient. And effective recruitment and retention processes.


Through our trials and triumphs, we learned that embracing AI. Wasn't just about adopting a new tool. But about reimagining what was possible for recruitment in the trucking industry. 


Section 5: Conclusion


Reflecting on our journey. It's clear that implementing the AI-powered recruiter in our recruitment strategy. Was a game-changing move. We took on the challenge of integrating AI navigated resistance and challenges. Seen firsthand its significant impact on our hiring process. We gleaned crucial lessons from. ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" and ""The Social Network,"". Underscoring the importance of embracing disruptive technologies.


But what does this mean for you, the reader? It means a beacon of light in the complex world of driver recruitment and retention. It represents an opportunity to revolutionize your recruitment process. And stay ahead in the competitive trucking industry. By shortcutting your time to success with my help. 


The importance of utilizing AI in the recruitment process cannot be overstated. As we learned, AI allows for faster, more efficient assignment processes. Saving valuable time so you can activate more candidates. Improving your funnels will enable them to predict the best fit for your company. Improving the quality of your hires. But perhaps most importantly, it scales. As your company grows, so too can your recruitment efforts. Without the need for increased headcount or resources.


But this journey isn't without its challenges. Significant hurdles include resistance to change, initial investment. And the effort to get it right.Yetr, the benefits far outweigh the trials. It's a journey that can transform your company's recruitment process, like it did ours.


Remember the story of Jake Harrison, our first successful hire using AI-powered recruiter. Jake was not just a successful hire. But a testament to the power of AI in revolutionizing recruitment. It was a moment akin to Facebook's user count rising. A sign that we had created something transformative.


As we move into the future, the role of AI in recruitment will only continue to grow. The trucking industry and countless others must adapt and innovate to keep up. The implementation of AI is no longer a matter of 'if' but 'when.'


So, as you turn the page and look towards your future in trucking recruitment. Remember the lessons from this book. Embrace the potential of AI, prepare for the challenges. And, above all, stay open to the power of disruptive technology.


Remember, the future of recruitment isn't found in a job ad or a resume - it's in the data.

Embrace growth hacking, join the recruitment revolution! 🚀🔥 #RecruitmentRevolution #TruckingIndustry #AI #Automation #GrowthHacking",Chapter 4: Sales Machine ,"Section 0 Where it all started.  
Have you ever felt that life was happening for you instead of to you? Where, out of nowhere. You meet the love of your life or a business partner or are exposed to an ideal that changes your life. You did not do anything… life brought it to you. I was lucky enough to have that happen to me on September 14th, 1992. I was at 303 2nd Street, 5th floor in San Francisco, California.  
It was the first day of work at my dream job in advertising. Wanting to start strong, I started working on a list of businesses that did not advertise with us. Trying to drum up some new business. I scheduled an appointment with a company to meet at my office the next day. He showed up disheveled looking, wearing a stained shirt with old shoes. I thought, what did I get myself into?  We went to the conference room, and I got to know him and his business. It turns out he is one of San Francisco's biggest restauranteurs (never judge a book by its cover). He owned most of the restaurants in fisherman wharf, and the crab stands on the sidewalk. We spent most of the day together. When we were done, we put together some great advertising campaigns. 
He required a lot of extra work from me, like creating a process map of how the advertising would be handled. I had to set up tracking phone numbers. And document what ads had what unique phone number. So we can track which advertising campaign generated the lead. And he followed who would receive the lead and the outcome of the lead. So, he could do an ROI on his ad spend.    
 
The first year I did this for this client, I hated it. Setting up remote call forwarding tracking phone numbers sucked. It took forever on the phone with the phone company. I felt like I was doing a bunch of work the customer should be doing. But I was young and in my ignorance. I thought my job was to create great advertising campaigns to make the phone ring with leads. And it was the customer's job to turn the calls from the advertising into a sale.   

In my second year at the company, they changed the compensation plan. Overnight it changed the game. Advertising results have become more important than your sales results. Many top salespeople took it on the chine. Lots of their big sales from the previous year were cancelled.
The restauranteur customer I hated doing the extra work for. He was my biggest client this year. It was renewal time. I thought to myself. Watch it be my luck that the client gave me the numbers to keep my job last year. Cancels this year, and I got let fired because I could not make up the lost revenue.  So, I made him my first appointment; that way, I had time to try and recover if it went sideways and he canceled. I did not have access to the call reporting numbers or the call outcomes the customer did. So the first question I asked was, how do the numbers look? 
Section 2 

After a long pause, he got excited and shared with me the call report. And what he did with the call information. And how the calls were routed to reservations, and when a table was reserved, he used that for verification of sale. Then he shared the average ticket per table and how many times he turned tables throughout the day. He explained that if the servers sold high-profit items. Like desserts or bottled water to 10% of the tables, he would make another 20% return on his advertising.    
 
He whipped up all the data like his head chief that makes the cioppino his restaurants are famous for. And created what he called his sales machine. He was a six-sigma black belt and explained that his sales machine came from manufacturing. But instead of manufacturing and having an assembly line where you're creating widgets. You're manufacturing and have an assembly line where you are creating customers. I was hooked at first sight. It was the first time I had seen the sales process visually.    
 
Then he told me he was making $5.00 for every dollar he spent on advertising. Needless to say, he did not cancel his advertising. There was proof of the results; with that proof his sales machine, I could sell him the expanded advertising program I had set up. That sale pushed me over the top, and I earned one of the coveted top sales awards that year. And almost every year I worked there, all because of my customer’s sales machine.

When I entered the recruitment industry. I used the sales machine I learned from my advertising client. To build my first recruitment company. To over a million dollars in sales in the first six months in business. After a couple of years, I was able to buy my way out of corporate America and went to work at the recruitment company full-time.    
 
The first thing I did was go to work adjusting my sales machine. To accommodate the recruitment process. Instead of manufacturing and having an assembly line where you're creating customers. Like the sales machine. You're manufacturing and have an assembly line where you are creating successful employees. And reasons for them to say.    
 
I have gone through several different versions of the recruitment engine over the last two decades. I made adjustments dictated by the market conditions. And I also made improvements from what I learned working on my growth marketing certification from Digital Marketer. If you want to know about digital marketing. I highly recommend Ryan Deiss and the team at Digital Marketer.    
 
The recruitment engine is how I manufacture and produce qualified candidates. To be hired repeatably and predictively. It is a visual representation of how candidates are created. So, you can reduce the time it takes to fill a position. Streamline the application process. Improve the candidate's experience. So you lose fewer candidates as they go through the six stages of the recruitment cycle. Automate repetitive tasks for the recruiter efficiently. To free up time for more critical work. Like getting more of the qualified candidates your recruiter talks to, to your job offer. So, your team has a better chance of making the right job-to-candidate match. And you have a high-performing employee.

Section 3 Growth Marketing   

What I discovered when studying the success of the world's biggest technology companies that have become market leaders. They have attributed their success to one thing. Their skill at exploiting growth marketing, or they call it hacking growth, to produce network effects. That’s the one skill that enabled them to become market leaders.   
 
Growth marketers or growth hackers are the people who are responsible for all the functions that improve business revenue. This can include everything from acquiring new customers and turning them into repeat purchasers. And re-engaging the clients that drop out of the sales process. And bring them back to complete the sale, to find new ways to re-engage former clients to buy again. And ways to convert visitors who did not buy to new customers.  
 
Growth marketing or growth hacking's goal is. Not to achieve linear growth by increasing the workforce. Instead, growth is achieved by removing bottlenecks or friction in your technology. That produces small wins compounded over time. You are ultimately turning small improvements into landslide competitive advantages. And the more you continue to make small improvements. The more efficient and valuable your recruitment and retention technology becomes. It’s kind of like compounded interest in your retirement account. The longer you do it, the more it multiplies and increases in value.  
 
This is accomplished by marrying creativity with data analysis, marketing, and messaging. It works because your decisions stay rooted in data. At the same time, you still apply creativity. And curiosity while surveying your candidates. And your talent acquisition team at critical steps of the process.  They use a growth engine to guide the improvements.
 
Network effects occur when the value of your technology increases as its number of users grows. Network effects are among the most important reasons you pick one product or service over another. This growth engine technology strategy is moving from sales. And the marketing side of the business. To the recruitment and retention side of the business. I adapted this process to my recruitment and retention technology strategy.  I created a recruitment engine That turns small improvements in the candidate's experience. Into landslide recruitment advantages, creating network effects.
 

It works through a feedback loop. Whereby small wins compounded over time strengthen the recruitment and retention process. That produces market-shifting advantages. That are not easy for the competition to knock off. Which is precisely what we are looking for. The outcomes are that technology is strengthened as improvements are made. So more of your candidates make it to your job offer. 

Now just a small improvement in hires every month. Is a massive improvement after a year. Multiply that over the years you are in business, and the advantages are market shifting. The benefits you will have when you do this are not easy for the competition to knock off. Your recruitment engine creates an extra barrier to entry from competitors. Trying to poach your recruitment and retention strategy or, worse… your employees.  
 
The longer you improve, the more attractive your company's employer brand. And recruitment messaging becomes creating even more intrinsic value. Positioning you as the employer of choice. That drives even more candidates toward your job offer. And that only continues your landslide advantage in the talent market.  

The world event that guided our path was the use of growth marketing. According to LinkedIn, Growth is so important right now. The growth marketing manager role is the No. 1 fastest-growing job in Canada and France. In the United States, head of revenue operations (definitely a growth role) tops the list. And three countries — India, Mexico, and the United Kingdom — listed the head of growth or chief growth officer among its top 10, at the time of the writing of this book.  
 
As you can see, this growth engine strategy is being adopted in all types of businesses worldwide. It requires a skill set that most people just don’t have. Companies that are not using this growth engine strategy. Are scrambling to hire people who can execute it to grow their company. Why? Because it works.   
 
This is the human strategy side of our Hybrid AI. That is reshaping recruitment and retention. So if you only execute an AI strategy. Without the human strategy of growth marketing, you will never experience the network effect. HR departments are following the lead of enterprise-sized companies. In adapting this strategy with their technology. We are entering a time when we can no longer set up a recruitment technology strategy and forget it again. It is complex, and then you add AI to the mix, which adds a whole new level of complexity; I understand I have been in your shoes. I will make it as simple for you as I can.   

Section 4 Introduce the recruitment engine. 
I bet you have never heard of a recruitment engine. Or know what a recruitment engine is? 

The creation of a recruitment engine. A recruitment engine is my customer's sales machine strategy. And the growth engine strategy from growth marketing. I combined those strategies and created a recruitment engine. It is the documented stages of the candidate's recruitment journey to your job offer. To create a funnel map of all conversion points to the job offer. 
 
We document the digital journey to identify friction and bottlenecks. If removed will give a better recruitment experience to your candidates. So fewer of them fall out as they move through the six stages of the recruitment cycle, and more qualified candidates will make it to your job offer. Getting you more hires and the most significant return for your time, effort, and investment. A recruitment engine is also the visual representation of your candidates' journey to your job offer. It starts when a candidate responds to an open job. And ends when the job offer is accepted or denied. Your company's recruitment cycle.    
 
Your recruitment engine also serves the purpose of the visual representation we will give the higher-ups to get the project approval. We will use our recruitment engine as evidence to support our claim. To show the benefits of doing the project. And the recruitment engine will also show you the consequences. Of not solving your recruitment and retention problem. It will highlight the parts of the recruitment process that are going well. And the areas that could be going better. To highlight bottlenecks and friction causing you to lose qualified candidates.  
 
To create your recruitment engine, we document your candidate's journey to your job offer. The six different stages in the candidate's experience. We do that with a tool I created, the recruitment cycle success path. The recruitment cycle success path is a series of stages that guide candidates. Through the recruitment experience with your company, from application to job offer. The stages in the candidate's experience make up your company’s recruitment engine.  
 
You break down each stage of the recruitment lifecycle into two experiences. The technology experience and the messaging experience. They have different objectives. But overlap and must be congruent to produce high-performing employees. So, let's go ahead and map the bottlenecks. And friction in the candidate’s technology experience. I will be going into some explanation of the messaging strategy to give context. To how all of the moving parts work together. My book, Reshaping Recruitment, Transformation of Employer Branding with AI and Advanced Automation, covers my complete messaging strategy. Based on Maslow’s needs theory, so our messaging talks to our candidates, not at them.  
________________________________________
Section 5 Recruitment Cycle Success Path.  
The recruitment cycle comprises four main milestones. Your candidate goes through on their journey to employment with your company. These milestones are: Welcome, Activate, Diagnose & Qualify, Prescribe & Job Offer, then after they are hired, they stop the recruitment life cycle and enter a new phase with the company. The employee life cycle. The process is simple. Straightforward and easy to understand for your candidates and the talent acquisition team.   
 
 
Section 1: Welcome    
 
Your new candidates enter the Welcome Stage. After they have been exposed to your job advertising or were sourced by your team. And are interested in learning more about the position. So they call, submit a resume or fill out an online application and become traffic you own. The candidates that your recruitment team did not talk to are moved to the activation stage.   
 
Section 2: Activate   
 
Most new canidates will land in the Activate stage. Because applicants would rather fill out a mini application or submit a resume than a call about the job. That causes the first bottleneck to get that canidates to your job offer. When a new candidate fills out an application or online form, your canidates automatically go into the activation stage. Because Your team must go through the extra work of following up to get your canidates on the phone to qualify. 

This is where most businesses stop and miss out on a great chance to build a relationship. This stage can also be a nurturing phase of the recruitment cycle to establish trust. And delivers value to build relationships with your candidates. Candidates can be moved into the activation stage. At different points in the recruitment cycle, they fall out.
 
Section 3: Diagnose & Qualify   
 
In this stage of the recruitment cycle. You start the prescreening with questions intended to determine if the candidate is qualified for the position. These questions are designed to diagnose not only a person's ability and skills. But also their career goals and ensure they align with company values. If the candidate is qualified, they move to the Prescribe & Job Offer Section. If not qualified, depending on the reason. They can go onto an alternative path to employment, or we choose not to recruit.   

Section 4: Prescribe & Job Offer    
 
In this stage, the outcome depends on the results of the interview. If you decide they are qualified. You want to make a job offer to get them on-boarded and start on their career path with your company. If they are not qualified now. You can prescribe an alternative path to employment if qualified.   
 
This is where the recruitment cycle ends. And the employee lifecycle starts. 

Section 5: Conclusion
In this journey, we have navigated the challenges of the trucking and logistics industry, understood the potential of AI in recruitment, and shared the transformative experience of a recruitment engine. We've learned from influential books and big tech and seen how AI can give businesses a competitive edge that's more crucial than ever in today's cutthroat market.
The decision to embrace AI in recruitment is no longer optional; it's a necessity. Faced with an acute driver shortage, companies must rethink their recruitment strategies. Hybrid AI offers not just an efficient recruitment process but a strategic tool. A recruitment engine that improves the quality of hire, enhances retention and ultimately impacts a company’s reputation and growth.
The book ""Hacking Growth "" and the network effect further underscore this truth. They illuminate the transformative power of Hybrid AI and the perils of clinging to outdated methods. The message is clear: There's no room for speculation or stagnation in the relentless pursuit of a competitive edge.
AI doesn't sleep; it constantly learns, adapts, and improves, working tirelessly to give your company the competitive edge it needs to succeed. It's time to step into the future of recruitment to use data-driven methods to attract and retain the best talent.
There’s an AI revolution unfolding, reshaping recruitment and retention. The choice is yours: to be part of the revolution and thrive, or ignore it and risk becoming irrelevant.
Action Steps:
1.	Research: Explore various AI-powered recruitment tools available in the market. Look for features relevant to your business, like data processing capacity, and industry-specific solutions.
2.	Evaluate: Consider your current recruitment process. Identify areas where AI could bring efficiency, reduce speculation, and enhance results.
3.	Invest: Commit to adopting an AI-powered recruiter and use your recruitment engine to make your recruitment more efficient. It's not just a purchase but an investment in your company's future.
4.	Review and refine: Regularly review your recruitment process and software. Look for areas of improvement and optimize their usage for better results creating the network effect.

With the AI-powered recruiter, hybrid AI and a recruitment engine, you can redefine recruitment, solve talent acquisition challenges, and gain the competitive edge you need to thrive. The future of recruitment is here. Embrace it.",1,2023-09-22T23:28:47.005999,42,1,blue,1,1,2023-08-12T15:58:09.271370,False,promotional,two-cta-two-content-belief

I had landed a giant recruitment contract. But I did not know I was not the only recruitment company with the contract. They also contracted with one of my biggest competitors. 
The big company had more people and more resources, and they were using them to beat me out for all the placements. I was in the fight of my business life. They did not like me being there and were determined to push me out. I needed to make placements, or I would lose the contract, and the big company would win. 

So I decided I would use the shotgun approach. I upped my advertising budget again and did a text message campaign for the candidates that were on my list (candidates I own). It kind of worked, and kind of didn’t work... here is what I mean. The number of candidates that responded to our job posting & text message campaign increased.   

But the number of people we hired only increased for some recruiters and not others. The strange thing I noticed about the results is. I would have 2 recruiters with the same skill set and get two wildly different results from them. You would think the results would be similar to each other. It was frustrating...I suspected that something was up. If I could solve this puzzle, I could easily double my profits with the same number of resources, ad spend, and effort I am using now.  

I started searching for any study, report, or any bit of creditable information on what would cause such a difference in performance with two equally skilled recruiters. I read article after article clicking link after link in the articles for what seemed like weeks until I finally ended up finding a study by Harvard business review. I found a study on sales companies' response rates 
 

Our research shows that most companies are not responding nearly fast enough… our research indicates that many firms are too slow to follow up on these leads. We audited 2,241 U.S. companies…. 24% took more than 24 hours—and 23% of the companies never responded at all. The average response time…. was 42 hours.  
These results are especially shocking given how quickly online leads go cold. Firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times as likely to qualify the lead….as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later—and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer.”’ 
Source: Harvard Business Review 
https://timetoreply.com/harvard-business-review/ 
 
The first time I read the report, I thought it had valuable information. And I put the report in my file to read again. I continued my search, but I could not find anything that useful. A few weeks passed, and I picked up the Harvard business review report to read it again. When I finished reading the report, I came to a different conclusion. Have you ever experienced that? You get a different message from the same report or book on a different read. 

This time reading the report, I realized the variable for success was not the sales skill of the salesperson. The variable for success was the speed at which the salesperson responded to the lead. Only after the salesperson was talking to a prospect did the sales skill come into play. 

I wondered if that was happening with my recruitment team. It would explain the discrepancy between the two recruiters with similar skills. With these market conditions, candidates rule the hiring process. Who knows. First, I needed to know how fast we respond to new candidates. To do that, we had to pull reporting from our phone system. And reporting from our hire-up funnel software and cross reference that will the call report to get the full picture. We broke it down by each recruiter extension and transfer.  

Here is what we uncovered each recruiter handled their new candidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason on how my recruiters responded to the new canidates they received from our advertising.  As we studied the data, a pattern started to emerge. We cross-referenced that with the placements report, and my suspicions were confirmed.  

Some of our recruiters responded to new canidates on the day they applied and they filled a lot more jobs than the recruiters that responded the following day or the following two days. There was a direct correlation between how fast a call, text, or resume was responded to by a recruiter. And the total number of people hired by that recruiter. 

The Harvard Business Review Report proved to ring true in recruiting candidates from the Internet. This means we lost a lot of candidates, which cost a lot of money. And wasted a lot of our recruiter's time following up trying to get these canidates on the phone to qualify. All because we delayed responding to new canidates one day. Is your team doing the same thing?  

Section 1 Ghosting Canidates 

That reminded me of a project we did for a client. They were having all kinds of issues with their hiring. So we did a survey of all the candidates they did not hire, and the results were eye-opening 30% of the candidates said that the recruiter ghosted them. Almost half of the ghosted candidates said it happened more than two times.    
 
This damaged their employer's brand. And can have a negative effect on future candidates from applying. It is critical that candidate ghosting does not happen. And adequate and appropriate feedback given to job seekers. No matter what stage of the hiring process they are in.    
 
Reshaping recruitment and retention is all about human interaction. It is not just about AI or an online experience; it has a human element. So, you must integrate human interaction with technology and AI to achieve the greatest results, hybrid AI. I worked with the team to determine the best way to respond to new candidates from our advertising. After weeks of trial and error. We tested different timelines on hundreds of new candidates from our advertising.   
 
AI crunched the data and showed that if we returned our candidates' first call. Text, application or resume within 15 minutes. We were six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. The team agreed that 15 minutes was a reasonable time to respond. So that became the new business rule.    
 
Section 2 Check & Balance:  

After that experience, I realized I needed a check and balance system. To ensure that my recruiters were treating each and every candidate the same. And the system informs the management team when business processes are not being followed. Or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure you do not miss a hiring deadline. To carry out this. We use check and balance rules in the workflow that could not be possible without automation with decision logic.    
 
Having check and balance rules in Hire up Funnels was an eye-opening experience for me. Before we put our check and balance in the workflow. We had no way to measure how our recruitment team followed up with canidates. Just like most of you.    
 
I did not know how long it took our recruiters to respond to new candidates from our advertising. Or if they were getting ghosted, It was like flying blind. With our check and balance rules. You will know if all your business’s best practices and recruitment rules are followed. Ensuring recruiter efficacy and good candidate experience. like flying with instruments, you know if you are on course or not, so you can correct and get back on track.    
 
Here is how the check and balance rules work. If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. Call a candidate back within 15 min of receiving a new candidate. The check and balance workflow would send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task and e-mail. Ensure a prompt callback and make sure the new candidate is not ghosted.    
 
Suppose this happens two times in a row. And the candidate is not called within the time limit of our business rules. In that case, the workflow sends a notification to the assigned recruitment manager. Who can then figure out why the new candidate. That you spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules. For the highest advertising-to-interview conversion ratio.    
 
Ensuring all candidates get a great experience. You are more productive; you hire more of the qualified candidates you are already talking to. The Hire Up funnels workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate. So, you hire more of the qualified canidates you are already talking to. Never worry if your team is not following best practices and rules. Our check and balance rules will keep you informed.   

After giving our team the information and tools to improve their results. Our team now has an average 5-minute response time to new candidates from our advertising. All recruiters have increased the number of hires. Some so much that you would not believe me if I shared them with you. Check and balance rules can carry out various tasks. We use several versions throughout our Hire Up Funnels.   
 
Section 3 Follow up programmed in check and balance rules.    
 
I wanted to beat the big company for the most placements badly. I dug a little deeper in the data and started to see a new pattern. I shared it with the team, and they confirmed it. When a candidate calls, text, or submit a resume. And if the call went to voicemail or a text was not returned, that started a domino effect of complications. The most time-consuming was the never-ending game of phone tag. To get the candidate back on the phone or respond to your text so you could activate. And start the recruitment process of qualification.    
 
I returned to my Hire up Funnels software and pulled reporting of follow-up attempts. To successful calls where we got the candidate on the phone to do the prescreening call to qualify. And move to the next stage of the recruitment cycle success path. 
 
The results were like the new candidate from advertising results. Every recruiter handled the new canidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason for how many follow-up calls a recruiter made. Everyone on the team had a different number of follow-up calls. We shared the results with the team. The high-performing recruiters made more follow-up calls than the low-performer ones. The report told us that 20% of the team gave up after only two follow-up attempts. That was disappointing...   
 
I shared the results with the team to see the best way to fix this. The recruiters that responded with the least number of follow-up calls. Shared some very valuable information with us. The main reason for not making as many follow-up calls. Was that they felt like they were pestering the candidates. And felt like they were being pushy. I can understand that.    
 
So, the big question was. How many times should candidates be called for the best contact, qualification, and hiring ratios? And so, your team knows the number of calls to make that they are not bothering candidates. So, we tested the candidates we had. To see the correct number of follow-ups. To get a candidate that responded to our job advertisement. On the phone who did not answer the recruiters' first return call.   
 
We tested calling, texting, and sending e-mails, and pixel targeting. It was surprising to learn that you must do much more follow-up than one would think for a job.  But you do not want to overdo it, burn out your candidates, and destroy your reputation in your market. The sweet spot is to be persistent but not a stalker. The stats told us that we needed to follow up seven. To eight times to get a candidate activated on the phone (without upsetting them). To do a prescreen call and qualify.    
 
Digging even deeper into the data. We also discovered that if we did not get the candidate on the phone in the first seven days after applying with us. They went cold and non-responsive. The tests we ran told us we got more people on the phone to prescreen. And qualify if we used a combination of phone calls and text messages, and e-mails.    
 
On a fluke my lead recruiter suggested that we try using our AI chatbot in our follow-up messages. To give our canidates the option to use the AI chatbot to book time to talk to the recruiter, and boy, did they.   
 
Section 4 Follow-up rules.    
 
We added follow-up rules to our check and balance workflow with that data. When the recruiter calls the new candidate back, the call is unanswered. We have a control requiring eight follow-ups for every new candidate not activated. The recruiter calls the candidate every other day for eight days. When the recruiter does not call. We set up the workflow to send our omnichannel communication.    
 
This way, we reach out to our candidate eight times in six days. With four calls from the recruiter and four automated Omni channel communication. Including AI chatbots, to schedule a call with a recruiter. Increasing the efficiency of our recruitment team. Getting more people on the phone. And into the qualification stage of the recruitment cycle.    
 
If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. The workflow would automatically send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task in their calendar and e-mail. If your recruiter does not adhere to the follow-up rules. Another reminder task is sent if this happens twice in a row. The candidate is not called within the time frame of our business rules. Then the workflow sends a notification. To the assigned recruitment manager. Who can figure out why the new candidate. That we spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules time frame.    
 
 
Ensure all candidates have a great recruitment experience. And we are more productive, so we hire more of the qualified candidates we are already talking to. The recruitment funnel workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate.  
 
Section 5 Conclusion 
 
Here is how important a good candidate's experience is. According to career plug. 80% of candidates said that a positive candidate experience influenced their decision to say yes to an offer. 58% of job seekers said that a poor candidate experience led them to decline a job.    
https://www.careerplug.com/blog/improve-hiring-with-better-communication/  
 
So, I adjusted my funnel with the check and balance rules of 15 min to return a call. And programed eight follow ups for every new candidate and relaunched it. Did some optimization and the team started to hire more people. We started to beat the big company for placements. With the same resources I was spending before I made the changes to the check and balance rules. It was an all-out war for the top spot. One week they would take the top spot, and the next week, we would take the top spot. This went on for several weeks, the competition was fierce. It was technology strategy versus strength, who would win?    
 
With a dedicated team and the right tools. We were able to track, measure and optimize our recruitment funnels. To become number one, we held the top spot to the end of the recruitment contract. Technology strategy wins over strength every time...    
 
Success is achieved by adjusting technology. To accommodate human behavior opened a whole new world for me. What else can I do to gain market advantage? So, I studied the biggest technology companies. To figure out how they grew so fast and became market leaders.   
 
Remember, there is something much bigger at play here than just data. As the data increases and the metrics become more trackable, It is easy to get sucked into the analytics of it all. And in the process, forget that there is a person on the other side of the metrics. A person with a problem, a person who needs you to solve their problem.

In today's job market, traditional recruitment strategies may not be enough. Stay ahead by exploring new approaches and finding the perfect fit for your team.  #Adaptability #JobMarket #HR #Recruiting #DataDrivenRecruitment",Introduction,"Picture this: A time in the not-so-distant future where job applications are screened, shortlisted, interviewed, and hired, not by human beings, but by artificial intelligence. Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.

Speed is everything when it comes to responding to leads. Learn from my experience and make sure you prioritize quick responses to maximize your chances of success. #LeadGenerationTips #SuccessSecrets,Chapter 3 Speed is what matters.,"I remember like it yesterday. I had landed a giant recruitment contract. But I did not know I was not the only recruitment company with the contract. They also contracted with one of my biggest competitors. 
The big company had more people and more resources, and they were using them to beat me out for all the placements. I was in the fight of my business life. They did not like me being there and were determined to push me out. I needed to make placements, or I would lose the contract, and the big company would win. 

So I decided I would use the shotgun approach. I upped my advertising budget again and did a text message campaign for the candidates that were on my list (candidates I own). It kind of worked, and kind of didn’t work... here is what I mean. The number of candidates that responded to our job posting & text message campaign increased.   

But the number of people we hired only increased for some recruiters and not others. The strange thing I noticed about the results is. I would have 2 recruiters with the same skill set and get two wildly different results from them. You would think the results would be similar to each other. It was frustrating...I suspected that something was up. If I could solve this puzzle, I could easily double my profits with the same number of resources, ad spend, and effort I am using now.  

I started searching for any study, report, or any bit of creditable information on what would cause such a difference in performance with two equally skilled recruiters. I read article after article clicking link after link in the articles for what seemed like weeks until I finally ended up finding a study by Harvard business review. I found a study on sales companies' response rates 
 

Our research shows that most companies are not responding nearly fast enough… our research indicates that many firms are too slow to follow up on these leads. We audited 2,241 U.S. companies…. 24% took more than 24 hours—and 23% of the companies never responded at all. The average response time…. was 42 hours.  
These results are especially shocking given how quickly online leads go cold. Firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times as likely to qualify the lead….as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later—and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer.”’

The first time I read the report, I thought it had valuable information. And I put the report in my file to read again. I continued my search, but I could not find anything that useful. A few weeks passed, and I picked up the Harvard business review report to read it again. When I finished reading the report, I came to a different conclusion. Have you ever experienced that? You get a different message from the same report or book on a different read. 

This time reading the report, I realized the variable for success was not the sales skill of the salesperson. The variable for success was the speed at which the salesperson responded to the lead. Only after the salesperson was talking to a prospect did the sales skill come into play. 

I wondered if that was happening with my recruitment team. It would explain the discrepancy between the two recruiters with similar skills. With these market conditions, candidates rule the hiring process. Who knows. First, I needed to know how fast we respond to new candidates. To do that, we had to pull reporting from our phone system. And reporting from our hire-up funnel software and cross reference that will the call report to get the full picture. We broke it down by each recruiter extension and transfer.  

Here is what we uncovered each recruiter handled their new candidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason on how my recruiters responded to the new canidates they received from our advertising.  As we studied the data, a pattern started to emerge. We cross-referenced that with the placements report, and my suspicions were confirmed.  

Some of our recruiters responded to new canidates on the day they applied and they filled a lot more jobs than the recruiters that responded the following day or the following two days. There was a direct correlation between how fast a call, text, or resume was responded to by a recruiter. And the total number of people hired by that recruiter. 

The Harvard Business Review Report proved to ring true in recruiting candidates from the Internet. This means we lost a lot of candidates, which cost a lot of money. And wasted a lot of our recruiter's time following up trying to get these canidates on the phone to qualify. All because we delayed responding to new canidates one day. Is your team doing the same thing?  

Section 1 Ghosting Canidates 

That reminded me of a project we did for a client. They were having all kinds of issues with their hiring. So we did a survey of all the candidates they did not hire, and the results were eye-opening 30% of the candidates said that the recruiter ghosted them. Almost half of the ghosted candidates said it happened more than two times.    
 
This damaged their employer's brand. And can have a negative effect on future candidates from applying. It is critical that candidate ghosting does not happen. And adequate and appropriate feedback given to job seekers. No matter what stage of the hiring process they are in.    
 
Reshaping recruitment and retention is all about human interaction. It is not just about AI or an online experience; it has a human element. So, you must integrate human interaction with technology and AI to achieve the greatest results, hybrid AI. I worked with the team to determine the best way to respond to new candidates from our advertising. After weeks of trial and error. We tested different timelines on hundreds of new candidates from our advertising.   
 
AI crunched the data and showed that if we returned our candidates' first call. Text, application or resume within 15 minutes. We were six times more likely to get those candidates on the phone. The team agreed that 15 minutes was a reasonable time to respond. So that became the new business rule.    
 
Section 2 Check & Balance:  

After that experience, I realized I needed a check and balance system. To ensure that my recruiters were treating each and every candidate the same. And the system informs the management team when business processes are not being followed. Or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure you do not miss a hiring deadline. To carry out this. We use check and balance rules in the workflow that could not be possible without automation with decision logic.    
 
Having check and balance rules in Hire up Funnels was an eye-opening experience for me. Before we put our check and balance in the workflow. We had no way to measure how our recruitment team followed up with canidates. Just like most of you.    
 
I did not know how long it took our recruiters to respond to new candidates from our advertising. Or if they were getting ghosted, It was like flying blind. With our check and balance rules. You will know if all your business’s best practices and recruitment rules are followed. Ensuring recruiter efficacy and good candidate experience. like flying with instruments, you know if you are on course or not, so you can correct and get back on track.    
 
Here is how the check and balance rules work. If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. Call a candidate back within 15 min of receiving a new candidate. The check and balance workflow would send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task and e-mail. Ensure a prompt callback and make sure the new candidate is not ghosted.    
 
Suppose this happens two times in a row. And the candidate is not called within the time limit of our business rules. In that case, the workflow sends a notification to the assigned recruitment manager. Who can then figure out why the new candidate. That you spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules. For the highest advertising-to-interview conversion ratio.    
 
Ensuring all candidates get a great experience. You are more productive; you hire more of the qualified candidates you are already talking to. The Hire Up funnels workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate. So, you hire more of the qualified canidates you are already talking to. Never worry if your team is not following best practices and rules. Our check and balance rules will keep you informed.   

After giving our team the information and tools to improve their results. Our team now has an average 5-minute response time to new candidates from our advertising. All recruiters have increased the number of hires. Some so much that you would not believe me if I shared them with you. Check and balance rules can carry out various tasks. We use several versions throughout our Hire Up Funnels.   
 
Section 3 Follow up programmed in check and balance rules.    
 
I wanted to beat the big company for the most placements badly. I dug a little deeper in the data and started to see a new pattern. I shared it with the team, and they confirmed it. When a candidate calls, text, or submit a resume. And if the call went to voicemail or a text was not returned, that started a domino effect of complications. The most time-consuming was the never-ending game of phone tag. To get the candidate back on the phone or respond to your text so you could activate. And start the recruitment process of qualification.    
 
I returned to my Hire up Funnels software and pulled reporting of follow-up attempts. To successful calls where we got the candidate on the phone to do the prescreening call to qualify. And move to the next stage of the recruitment cycle success path. 
 
The results were like the new candidate from advertising results. Every recruiter handled the new canidates differently. There was no rhyme or reason for how many follow-up calls a recruiter made. Everyone on the team had a different number of follow-up calls. We shared the results with the team. The high-performing recruiters made more follow-up calls than the low-performer ones. The report told us that 20% of the team gave up after only two follow-up attempts. That was disappointing...   
 
I shared the results with the team to see the best way to fix this. The recruiters that responded with the least number of follow-up calls. Shared some very valuable information with us. The main reason for not making as many follow-up calls. Was that they felt like they were pestering the candidates. And felt like they were being pushy. I can understand that.    
 
So, the big question was. How many times should candidates be called for the best contact, qualification, and hiring ratios? And so, your team knows the number of calls to make that they are not bothering candidates. So, we tested the candidates we had. To see the correct number of follow-ups. To get a candidate that responded to our job advertisement. On the phone who did not answer the recruiters' first return call.   
 
We tested calling, texting, and sending e-mails, and pixel targeting. It was surprising to learn that you must do much more follow-up than one would think for a job.  But you do not want to overdo it, burn out your candidates, and destroy your reputation in your market. The sweet spot is to be persistent but not a stalker. The stats told us that we needed to follow up seven. To eight times to get a candidate activated on the phone (without upsetting them). To do a prescreen call and qualify.    
 
Digging even deeper into the data. We also discovered that if we did not get the candidate on the phone in the first seven days after applying with us. They went cold and non-responsive. The tests we ran told us we got more people on the phone to prescreen. And qualify if we used a combination of phone calls and text messages, and e-mails.    
 
On a fluke my lead recruiter suggested that we try using our AI chatbot in our follow-up messages. To give our canidates the option to use the AI chatbot to book time to talk to the recruiter, and boy, did they.   
 
Section 4 Follow-up rules.    
 
We added follow-up rules to our check and balance workflow with that data. When the recruiter calls the new candidate back, the call is unanswered. We have a control requiring eight follow-ups for every new candidate not activated. The recruiter calls the candidate every other day for eight days. When the recruiter does not call. We set up the workflow to send our omnichannel communication.    
 
This way, we reach out to our candidate eight times in six days. With four calls from the recruiter and four automated Omni channel communication. Including AI chatbots, to schedule a call with a recruiter. Increasing the efficiency of our recruitment team. Getting more people on the phone. And into the qualification stage of the recruitment cycle.    
 
If the recruiter did not adhere to the follow-up rules. The workflow would automatically send a reminder to the recruiter. To call the candidate by a task in their calendar and e-mail. If your recruiter does not adhere to the follow-up rules. Another reminder task is sent if this happens twice in a row. The candidate is not called within the time frame of our business rules. Then the workflow sends a notification. To the assigned recruitment manager. Who can figure out why the new candidate. That we spent a lot of money to get was not contacted within the business rules time frame.    
 
 
Ensure all candidates have a great recruitment experience. And we are more productive, so we hire more of the qualified candidates we are already talking to. The recruitment funnel workflow ensures the ball does not get dropped. By automating follow-up and task communication with check and balance rules. Making certain best practices. And your business rules are being followed with each and every candidate.  
 
Section 5 Conclusion 
 
Here is how important a good candidate's experience is. According to career plug. 80% of candidates said that a positive candidate experience influenced their decision to say yes to an offer. 58% of job seekers said that a poor candidate experience led them to decline a job.    
https://www.careerplug.com/blog/improve-hiring-with-better-communication/  
 
So, I adjusted my funnel with the check and balance rules of 15 min to return a call. And programed eight follow ups for every new candidate and relaunched it. Did some optimization and the team started to hire more people. We started to beat the big company for placements. With the same resources I was spending before I made the changes to the check and balance rules. It was an all-out war for the top spot. One week they would take the top spot, and the next week, we would take the top spot. This went on for several weeks, the competition was fierce. It was technology strategy versus strength, who would win?    
 
With a dedicated team and the right tools. We were able to track, measure and optimize our recruitment funnels. To become number one, we held the top spot to the end of the recruitment contract. Technology strategy wins over strength every time...    
 
Success is achieved by adjusting technology. To accommodate human behavior opened a whole new world for me. What else can I do to gain market advantage? So, I studied the biggest technology companies. To figure out how they grew so fast and became market leaders.   
 
Remember, there is something much bigger at play here than just data. As the data increases and the metrics become more trackable, It is easy to get sucked into the analytics of it all. And in the process, forget that there is a person on the other side of the metrics. A person with a problem, a person who needs you to solve their problem.

Objections are a natural part of the sales process, and they offer an opportunity to connect with prospects and demonstrate your expertise.

Say goodbye to traditional methods and embrace AI for faster, efficient hiring.   (PC: nordwood, Unsplash)",8 To Activate or Not to Activate...,"
The last two chapters showed you the benefits of. Controlling the technology in the lead capture and application process. We covered four ways to increase the number of canidates filling out an application. So you can get the largest candidate-to-application conversion ratio. We also shared the number one variable for getting a new candidate activated. It’s not the skill of the recruiter, it is the speed at which you reach out. And to do that, you used technology. 


It was a delicate balance optimizing our hire-up funnels software. We use in AI-powered recruiter. To produce the outcomes we wanted and not sacrificing the candidate's experience. At the same time, making software easy to use with tools to streamline the process. And make our recruitment team more efficient. In one of our user experience meetings with the recruitment team. We decided to figure out how to activate more new candidates. So, the team and I analyzed our data. And concluded that we needed to create a new recruitment funnel. To do the follow-up for the activation stage. 






While rewarding, the transition to AI-powered recruitment wasn't devoid of challenges and resistance. People are generally resistant to change. Especially when it involves disrupting their traditional ways of working. Yet, as Harvard Business Review illustrates in their report. ""The Short Life of Online Sales Leads,"". The determining factor for improvement in activation is the response rate. Which is the speed at which you respond to new canidates. Not the skills of the recruiter.




When you control the technology in the lead capture and application process. Here is a perfect opportunity to increase. The efficiency of our recruitment team with no effort on their part. 


Automating the new candidate assignment process. Is precisely the sort of disruptive innovation that leads to significant growth. And by doing that, we drastically increase the number of applications. That convert to prescreen interviews. Our top recruiter responds to a new application within five minutes of receiving it. Speed is important. But our success is because of the one-two go for the knockout punch we use to activate new canidates. 


The first punch is the speed at which we respond to new applications. The second punch is the pre-frame video. With automated omnichannel communication used to engage new canidates. And get them on the phone to start the qualification process. The knockout punch is the co-pilot in our follow-up strategy. Ensuring every candidate are followed up. With the exact number of calls to maximize your new candidate activation rate. But not every candidate that applies gets activated. Some get stuck in the black hole of activation. 


To solve this problem, I looked to see if other types of tech companies had the same problem. My research discovered that social media companies, apps. And gaming companies have the same problem. They spend a lot of time and money to get people to sign up as new users. In recruitment, we spend lots of money to get them to apply. Fortunately, we share the same problems as those tech companies. 




They have new users who do not activate, just like our canidates. If they cannot get a newly subscribed user to activate and start using the software. They lost all of the money, time, and effort in getting a new subscriber in the first place. Just like we do… if we cannot get every candidate to the pre-screen interview. 


I thought we had it bad. The gaming industry’s activation process is way more complex than ours. Activation is vital to the success of all technology platforms today. These companies have dedicated unknown amounts of money. And thousands of hours to their growth teams. To solve this problem. 


Thank God the recruitment and retention activation process is much simpler. And these big Tech companies have already figured out the solution for us. So, we are going to copy and deploy the activation strategy from Big Tech. To leapfrog our activation results years ahead, saving us lots of time on testing and a ton of money. 




Section 1 Trigger Message 


One of the ways big tech activates new customers is with trigger messages. Trigger messages are part of the digital world; every platform uses them. Their purpose is to provoke a response in people. Like the notification that you received a new e-mail or a new connection request in social media. How effective triggers are is based on two things. How much do they motivate candidates to act? And how easy it is for your candidate to make the request. 




Big Tech's use of this messaging technique. Proves that trigger messages are one of the most effective ways. To increase re-engagement with your new candidates in the activation stage. The gaming industry creates trigger messages based on psychological research. From Robert Cialdini's book. Influence The psychology of persuasion. It is a good book if you want to get into the granular details of persuasion. There are six principles of persuasion, and they use them in their trigger messages. 


· Reciprocity: The reciprocity principle recognizes that people feel indebted. To those who do something for the


· Comment and Consistency: Once people take an action. They are more inclined to take that action again. 




· Social Proof: When uncertain, people look to the actions of others to help make their decision 




· Authority: People look to people in a position of authority to decide which action to take 
· Liking: people are inclined to do business with the people. And companies they like over those they don't or are indifferent to 


· Scarcity: People will take action if they are worried they will miss out on an opportunity in the future. 


I modeled the gaming industry trigger messages. And adjusted them for recruitment and created or trigger messages. Here is what a trigger message is in recruitment. Their purpose is to provoke a response in new candidates to contact us. It is a message that uses one or more of the six principles of persuasion. To get the candidate to pick up the phone and call you or start a two-way text conversation. or click a link to the recruiter calendar and schedule an appointment to talk about the job. Or interact with a bot or AI virtual assistant 




I shouldn’t say anything but… We are currently testing out. 100% personalized messaging strategy with AI to activate more canidates. It is so cool; here is what we do. When a canidates fills out an application. That triggers a bot to read the application. Or resume and then go read the candidate’s Facebook profile. And LinkedIn profile as well as their last three posts to be trained on that person. Then that we can send a prompt to AI and have it create a personalized message created. Based on one of the six principles of persuasion. To create personalized trigger messages. The results are off the chart. The next big thing we are working on is. Creating the capacity to be able to send personalized messaging at scale. 




In the old days the only tool. Your recruitment team had to activate new candidates. Was the phone and manually sending out emails. Now we use an automated workflow. In our new candidate activation funnel with omni-Channel communication. 




Section 2: Lesson learned from Hyper Responsive Buyers. 


Perry Marschall is one of the people I have learned a lot about pay-per-click advertising. And online sales and marketing. I am a big fan of his business philosophy. And book on 80/ 20 Sales and Marketing: The Definitive Guide to Working less and Making More. He really tweaks my brain when he gets into the 80/20 Squared concept, where there is an 80/20 in every 80/20. Being in Perry Marshal's follow-up funnel. I received an e-mail from him introducing me to. Dr. Glen Livingston, Ph D. Dr. Glen Livingston's expertise is in marketing consulting for Fortune 500 companies. He has this concept of hyper responsive buyers. They are buyers that have a problem they want to solve and want to solve it now. And if they cannot solve their problem with you, they will go where they can solve it (sounds like a job seeker). To identify these hyper-responsive buyers. Dr. Glen Livingston has a system of surveying the market to understand their problems. With that knowledge, he knows how to address their problem. And attract these hyper-responsive buyers. 


Whin i thought of it in the contaxt of recrutment. That made so much sense to me that I surveyed all the people I was hiring. And all the candidates in my hire-up funnels. So I could learn what was important to them, and the results were eye-opening. Since discovering Dr. Glen Livingston. I have practiced his survey method to improve my recruitment and sales funnels. 


Years later, I learned about Ryan Levesque. One of Dr. Glen's Students and the #1 bestselling author of Ask and Choose, the creator of the Ask Method. He took Dr Glen survey formula to another level and perfected the survey method. Into an easy-to-do quiz and created the software to deploy the quiz. With little to no Tech skills, which he used to propel The ASK Method® Company to a 4-time Inc. 5000 Fastest Growing Company Honoree 2017,2018,2019,2021. 


Many of the people who purchased this book. Went through one of our many assessments, surveys, diagnostics, or quizzes. I learned from Dr. Glen Livingston and my coaching experience with The Ask Method Company. We are continually gathering data on the people we recruit. And our customers to serve them better. I recommend you read Ryans books and check out his system. 


Section 3: Increase the activation rate of new candidates.


In our effort to provide a better candidate experience. And see how we can increase the activation rate of new candidates, we survey them. The first question we asked in the survey was why did you start looking for a job? I thought it would be easier to notice this answer. But the candidates answers were to a specific situation they experienced. We would get answers like they changed my schedule. Would not let me take the time off I asked for. The manager treated me badly (that is the tame version). Looking for more money or better benefits, I moved, or I changed my career, etc. We saw the pattern. When we grouped the answers into categories. Most people fell into the ""mad at company” category. There were other categories, but there needed to be more people to count it. 


The survey told us, these people started looking for a job ""not"" because they did not have one. They started looking for a job. Because something happened to them at work or in their personal life that made them want to leave. These were the perfect examples of a hyper-responsive candidate Dr. Glen Livingston discussed. 


The next question I asked was. When you are looking for a job, do you do research on the company before you apply, or do you do research after you apply? Here is what the survey told us. If the candidate was an hourly employee. They did more research after they applied at the company versus before. If they were a salaried employee. They did more research before they applied versus after they applied. But both categories did research before and after they applied. It was basically a coin toss. 


There was one more question in the survey that enlightened us. The question was. If there was something you did not like about the company, you applied for employment at. At the first place, you did research. Do you keep looking or quit looking? 53% said that they quit, and 47% kept looking. That sparked my interest. 


It reminded me of a concept called pre-framing, or some people call it setting the stage. Advanced internet marketers commonly use it. Pre-framing is a technique used to get someone to see a situation from a specific viewpoint. Before addressing it, it's designed to control the direction of the conversation. I used pre-framing on the sales side of my business with good results. It helped me convert more prospects into buyers.


Pre Fraim example


Here is an example. Let's say you are looking for a job and find one you are interested in. So, you started researching the company. You went to a website that said this company is terrible to work for. They don't respect their employees. How likely would you want to work there or answer a phone call from someone from that company? Not very likely. 


On the other hand, let's say you researched the exact same company. You went to a website, that says this is the greatest company to work for. It is the best job I have ever had; they look out for you and treat you with respect. What is the likelihood you would want to work there? Verry likely and look forward to a call about the job. What was the difference? What was said on the website per-framed that person's opinion of the company. That is the power of the pre-frame. Pre-framing is a technique used to get someone to see a situation from a specific viewpoint. Before addressing it, it's designed to control the direction of the conversation.


I decided to try pre-framing the candidates who filled out a mini-application. Or submitted a resume before they entered the activation stage. I decided to pre-frame their opinion about the company. So, they feel good about their decision to apply and call us or take a call from our recruiter. 


The pre-Fraim content positions the company in a good light. Introducing the culture and values to the candidates to see if we could get them to call us. We tested several different video messages. Some of them increased our conversions a bit, most did nothing, and one did a lot. 


At the time, I was doing an online product launch made famous by Jeff Walker. If you don't know what a product launch is. It's like a webinar but broken down into 4 to 5 smaller videos and delivered over a week's time. To gauge how the launch was performing, I went to the video analytics to see how it was going, and one video stood out. It had the lowest bounce rate of all videos. And the highest number of people who started the video and watched it to the end. I had to see what everyone was so interested in. 


I watched the video, and it was me telling my company story. I explained why I started the company, what we stood for, and where I wanted to take the company. As I watched it, I thought It was perfect for the pre-frame content. So, we used that as the model for our clients to use. They would tell their founder’s story as their pre-frame content. 


After our canidates filled out the mini-application or submitted a resume. We would send a welcome e-mail with the pre-frame video. The pre-frame video converted more candidates who filled out a mini-application. To talking to a recruiter in the pre-screen qualification process. 


Eliminating your most significant pain in the butt. The endless game of follow-up when you are stuck in the activation stage. My recruitment team sure appreciates it. When canidates do not get stuck in the activation stage. The next challenge was getting more views on the pre-frame video. So I could convert more candidates to calling us avoiding the activation stage altogether. 


Section 4: More Views on Pre-Frame Video


One day I was online doing research. I came across a webinar from a very respected marketing strategist I wanted to attend. I opted in and paid the fee, and on the thank you page, he had a video on it. When I saw it, it hit me like a ton of bricks. What a great idea to put the video on the thank you page. If I did that with my mini application. Every candidate completed a mini application. Or, if you submitted a resume, would see the pre-Fraim video on the thank you page. So, I gave it a try. 




After the candidate finished filling out the mini application. Or upload a resume and hit the submit button. They are taken to our thank you page, and our pre-frame video would instantly play. Introducing the company, how and why it was created, and sharing a little about our culture and values. The video views went up dramatically. 




From that pre-frame video. We were able to convert tons of candidates that filled out a mini application. Or up loaded a resume to pick up the phone and call us about the job. Eliminating your biggest pain in the but. The endless time-wasting game of follow-up in the activation stage. That is required to activate a new candidate. 


Click To Call 


I was very happy with the results, but I just kept wondering what I could do to make it even better. In my quest to get better results, the data told me over 80% of my applications were filled out on a mobile device. You cannot watch the video and make a call on the phone. So, I added a click-to-call button for mobile users. And put our phone number under the pre-frame video for desktop users on the thank you page. Our conversion of mini-application and resume to calling us skyrocketed. Drastically reducing the number of new candidates. That ended up in the activation stage. And that made the recruitment team happy 😊 


We had so many people call from the thank you page it screwed up our new candidate assignment process. One recruiter would get the phone call. And a different recruiter would get the mini-application. That caused some confusion, but we figured it out and accomplished our goal. We increased the number of candidates we activated. And pre-screened for noextral expense. With this recruitment funnel. We get our candidates on the phone or on a Zoom call. With our recruitment team, that is predictable and repeatable. Giving you a better chance of finding high-performing candidates. At the same time, we build employer brand value with the candidates we hired and the ones we did not hire
They say you never get a second chance to make a good first impression. In the world of recruiting high performers. The first impression your company makes is through your technology. When you control the technology in the lead capture and application process. Here is a perfect opportunity to increase the efficiency of our recruitment team with no effort on their part. 


Conclusion


Automating the new candidate assignment process completly changed the game for me. Its precisely the sort of disruptive innovation that leads to our significant growth. And by doing that. We could drastically increase the number of applications. That are converted to prescreen interviews. Speed is important, But I feel our success is the one-two go for the knockout punch we use to activate new canidates. 




The first punch is the speed at which we respond to new applications. The second punch is the pre-frame video with the click-to-call. The knockout punch is the automated omni-channel communication. Used to get new canidates on the phone to start the qualification process. Along with the co-pilot in our follow-up strategy. Ensuring every candidate is followed up. The exact number of times to maximize your new candidate activation rate. 


In the end, the key to success lies not only in the technology we use but in how we use it. Embrace the future, but do so with wisdom, foresight, and a sense of purpose.

Intuition and limited reach won't cut it. Assess job complexity for better fits. Boost strategies, cut turnover. #TruckingIndustry #Hiring",Chapter 1: Navigating the Hiring Highway,"
Over two decades ago, when I first entered the fascinating world of trucking and logistics recruitment, it was a different era. Hiring was a straightforward process back then, perhaps even rudimentary compared to today's standards. The industry was growing, and jobs were plentiful. Looking back, those were the days of simplicity in the hiring landscape.
But as the adage goes, ""Change is the only constant."" The tides of time swirled, and so did the logistics and trucking industry. The big problem was the driver shortage, a persistent thorn in the side of an industry otherwise buzzing with opportunity. It felt like being stranded on a highway with a truck full of promises but no drivers to steer it.
I struggled with this relentless challenge, tirelessly brainstorming strategies to attract and retain the drivers we hired. At times, it seemed like an impossible task. But I wasn't alone. The entire industry was facing the same predicament. We just started the AI revolution, and industries worldwide were turning to technology as their savior. Intrigued and inspired, I contemplated if AI could be our knight in shining armor.
The world event that revolutionized hiring was the adoption of Chat GPT. AI and automation in recruitment and retention processes. It happened slowly at first, but its impact was profound. Companies using AI and automation were beating out companies not using AI and automation. Companies started using AI-powered recruitment systems to automate recruitment workflows and automate communication through omnichannel. They even had ways to inform you how fast your recruitment team returned canidates calls and texts, ensuring the best canidates to application ratio. And no canidates get ghosted, providing a great candidate experience. So more of your qualified candidates make it to your job offer. Giving your team the canidates needed to make the best job-to-candidate match. 
From the shadows of this transformation emerged a glimmer of hope. Could we, too, harness the power of technology to tackle our recruitment woes? The promise was enticing, and the opportunity immense.
In this chapter, we'll traverse the hiring highway, shedding light on traditional hiring methods and exploring the role of technology in modern hiring processes. We'll delve into my personal journey and how my perspective on hiring has evolved. Drawing inspiration from the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" and the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" we'll learn to identify talent and overcome adversity. Buckle up, for an enlightening ride awaits us on the hiring highway.
Section 1 - Analysis of traditional hiring methods in the trucking industry
Steering back to the beginning of my career, hiring in the trucking industry was an art rooted in gut feelings, intuition, and personal judgment. Candidates were assessed primarily based on their ability to handle a truck, commitment to the job, and willingness to spend long hours on the road. They were face-to-face interactions, handshake deals, and decisions made around the coffee table. It was all incredibly human and intensely personal.
The process took time and often hit-or-miss. While we celebrated when we found the right fit, it was back to square one when we didn't. It was incredibly challenging to assess a candidate's commitment, adaptability, and resilience through just an interview or two. Our assessment was based largely on their past driving record and the charm of their personality.
Furthermore, the hiring process was localized. We predominantly relied on local talent pools or word-of-mouth referrals. Our go-to recruitment strategy was placing a help wanted ad in the local newspaper or at the town job fair to fill jobs. In some ways, it was comforting, familiar. But it was also limiting.
This traditional approach began showing its cracks as the industry grew more competitive. Trucking is about more than just driving from point A to point B. It's about adhering to tight schedules, maintaining the vehicle, managing on-road challenges, and ensuring the safe and timely delivery of goods while being a customer service rep. And most importantly, it's about doing all this consistently, day in and day out, while providing a great customer experience. 
These complexities were often overlooked in traditional hiring practices. As a result, we ended up hiring drivers who were good at driving but needed help with the other aspects of the job. The result? High turnover rates and a constant struggle to keep our complete fleet on the road.
As I navigated these challenges, I saw the need for a more robust, comprehensive hiring strategy that considered a candidate’s driving skills and overall suitability for the job. The seeds of change were sown. But what I needed was a game changer, a revolutionary approach that would take our hiring strategy from basic to brilliant.
Section 2 - The Role of Technology in modern hiring processes
The AI (artificial intelligence) Technology revolution began to assert its role in the modern hiring process during this quest for a new approach. Inspired by industries that were seamlessly integrating AI and automation in their hiring practices, I pondered upon its potential in ours.
As we dove deeper into the realm of technology, we discovered a world brimming with possibilities. Candidate Relation Management Systems (CRM) Built on advanced automation platforms. Equipped with AI capabilities were revolutionizing the way hiring was done. 
The sophisticated system had four different advanced automation systems running in the background. To provide your team with the right tools and system to streamline the recruitment processes. It promised recruiter efficiency, accuracy, and a significant reduction in time-to-hire by providing a great candidate experience. 
Moreover, data-driven hiring became a possibility. We could analyze historical data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. AI brought the power of predictive analytics, enabling us to foresee hiring trends, anticipate needs, and strategize accordingly. We could answer critical questions like: What traits do our best drivers share? What makes a driver stay with us for the long term?
Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual reality tools opened avenues for a more engaging candidate experience. Prospective drivers could interact with chatbots to get immediate answers to their queries. Virtual reality could give them a realistic simulation of their job, leading to better-informed decisions.
The role of technology in modern hiring processes extends beyond just finding and hiring the right candidate. It also played a significant part in onboarding and retaining the hired talent. Technology made keeping the drivers engaged and committed easier, from AI-assisted onboarding programs to regular check-ins and feedback loops.
Looking at all these possibilities, I was in awe of how technology could be a game changer. It had the potential to address the very issues we had been struggling with. It was a revolutionary, data-driven, and efficient approach to an age-old problem. As I stood on the brink of this technological revolution, I was convinced that this was the path we needed to tread.
Section 3 - My journey and the evolution of my perspective on hiring
In my journey from just a recruiter to being the top Digital Recruitment and Retention Strategies for the trucking and logistics industry.  I've weathered numerous storms and celebrated countless victories. Each phase offered a learning experience and substantially altered my perspective on hiring.
I started my career when hiring was primarily a personal affair. Hiring is based on a face-to-face interview and a person’s willingness to work hard. It was the age of intuition-based hiring. That's not to say it was flawed - I was a testament to its success. But as I moved up the ladder, I realized it was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.
I remember distinctly, a time in the early stages of my recruitment career when we were struggling with high turnover. We had a team of hard-working drivers, but they weren't staying. The strain of long hours, tight schedules, and road challenges was taking its toll. This was my first brush with the limitations of traditional hiring methods.
I realized then that hiring for the trucking industry needed more than just intuition - it required understanding the complexities of the job and assessing the candidate's capability to handle them. It was about hiring drivers who wouldn't just drive but thrive in the high-pressure, challenging trucking environment of today.
As I wrestled with these challenges, I discovered the potential of technology to transform our hiring process. What initially seemed like a daunting, almost alien concept started making sense. The more I delved into it, the more I saw its potential to streamline our hiring, expand our reach, and drastically improve our success rate.
My journey through the adoption of AI in hiring echoed the broader AI revolution that was transforming industries worldwide. It was a period of rapid evolution and change. Companies that embraced AI and advanced automation were propelling ahead, while those that resisted were falling behind.
In this whirlwind of change, I found inspiration in the book ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. They advocated a data-driven, structured approach to hiring - a methodology that could potentially revolutionize our hiring process. I also found motivation in the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". The protagonist's resilience, commitment, and relentless pursuit of his dream was a reflection of the kind of drivers we wanted to hire. I was able to harness the power of AI by following the lead from wall street quants. The dynamic world of Wall Street, known for its rapid fortunes made or lost, has seen the game completely changed with the introduction of AI and Quants. 
These influences shaped my perspective, leading me to understand that the key to successful hiring lay in a harmonious blend of technology and human touch. Humanity was becoming the new technology. I realized that while AI and automation could do much of the heavy lifting, the human element was critical in making the final call. After all, it was about finding people who would be the face of our company on the road. 
Section 4 - Learning from the reference book and movie, with a focus on identifying talent and overcoming adversity
I found valuable lessons in ""Who: The A Method for Hiring"" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. The book gave me the tools to chart a course in the tumultuous seas of hiring, particularly as it focused on hiring for attitude and potential. They emphasized how it's not always about the qualifications or experience; it's about who they are as individuals and whether they align with the company's values and culture.
Their concept of the A player - an employee that has at least a 90 percent chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10 percent of possible candidates could achieve - resonated deeply. The A player for us was a driver who not only drove but also represented our company's values, was the face of our company, maintained strong customer relationships, and upheld the highest safety standards.
However, finding these A players required a change in our hiring approach. We needed to look beyond just the driving skills and delve deeper into their attitude, resilience, and potential. We needed a structured, data-driven approach that combined technology and human intuition - the perfect blend of artificial and emotional intelligence. 
This reminded me of how AI gave Wall Street Firms an edge over the competition. However, when AI became widely adopted, this advantage faded. This is where Quants, the heroes of wall street, stepped in. They brought forth a revolutionary approach, Hybrid AI. Where we use the best of human intelligence paired with artificial intelligence. The firms that adopted this approach by the Quants pulled ahead of the competition, redefining the leaders on wall street. 
Wall streets evolution parallels the current state of recruitment and retention. As quants disrupted Wall Street with Hybrid AI, recruitment and retention strategist are becoming the “quants” of HR. We are using Hybrid AI to improve recruitment and retention in the trucking and logistics industry. Where humans make the final decision aided by the data from AI. 
This is where the lessons from the movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" came into play. The protagonist, Chris Gardner, was the embodiment of resilience and determination. He was a man with limited resources and opportunities, yet his unyielding determination to provide for his son and pursue his dream job was inspiring.
Gardner was a perfect example of an A player. He didn't have the qualifications or experience, but his attitude and resilience were unmatched. He was the kind of driver we wanted - one who would persist through challenges, remain committed to the job, and continuously strive for excellence.
The movie was a stark reminder that adversities can be overcome with a resilient spirit and a relentless pursuit of happiness. It was a reflection of the challenges our drivers faced - long hours, road hazards, solitude - and yet, with the right attitude and support, they could overcome them.
Bringing these lessons into our hiring process, we reshaped our strategy. We deployed AI tools to screen for skill-based parameters, freeing us to focus on personal traits during interviews. We looked for traits like resilience, determination, and a positive attitude, traits that we had overlooked in our traditional hiring approach.
We started conducting behavioral interviews, posing situational questions to assess how they would react in challenging scenarios. How did they handle a particularly challenging delivery? How did they cope with the solitude on long hauls? How did they deal with difficult customers or situations?
We began to see a change as we integrated these lessons into our hiring process. Our hiring decisions were becoming more informed, our driver pool was strengthening, and our retention rates were improving. We were making headway in our battle with the driver shortage.
Section 5 - Conclusion: Navigating the Road Ahead
The transformation in our recruitment approach was not an overnight occurrence; it was a journey paved with trials, errors, and learnings. However, these changes were essential and long overdue, not just for our company but for the trucking industry as a whole.
The lessons we learned, the improvements we made, and the progress we witnessed were encouraging. We managed to turn the wheels of our recruitment process, steering it away from traditional, limiting hiring practices towards a future defined by innovation, inclusivity, and intelligence. We succeeded in integrating the nuances of our industry, the essence of our drivers, and the power of technology into our hiring process.
Yet, as with any journey, ours is ongoing, and we continue to learn, adapt, and evolve. We are by no means perfect, and the driver shortage problem is far from resolved. But we are better than the competition, and that's what matters.
The AI revolution is reshaping recruitment and retention in the trucking industry, and its adoption is not a matter of” if” but “when.” The driver shortage is a pressing issue that warrants immediate attention and creative solutions. Advanced technology, AI, and automation present themselves as powerful allies in this fight. If you can connect the dots of strategy to use AI and advanced automation for you. 
The integration of technology in our hiring process has offered us insights, solutions, and opportunities we could not have imagined. It has allowed us to explore a wealth of untapped potential and resources that can prove to be game-changers in our industry.
However, technology is only a tool; its successful implementation and impact depend heavily on the user. A hammer in the hands of a child is merely a toy, but in the hands of a sculptor, it can create masterpieces. Similarly, AI and automation can transform the recruitment landscape in our industry, but only if used strategically and wisely.
And in this endeavor, empathy and understanding are our guiding lights. It's about remembering that behind every application and resume is a person with hopes, dreams, fears, and responsibilities. It's about knowing that a driver is not just a worker, but an ambassador of our company, a custodian of our goods, and a crucial link in our economic chain.
I implore other industry leaders, HR professionals, and transport managers to embrace this new dawn, challenge traditional norms, and navigate uncharted territories. The road ahead is uncertain, filled with challenges and opportunities alike. But if we navigate it together, sharing insights, learnings, and best practices, we can shape a future where driver shortages are a thing of the past, and the industry thrives with committed, competent, and content drivers.
Let this chapter serve as an invitation to embark on this transformative journey where technology meets talent acquisition. Remember, it's not about merely surviving the driver shortage but thriving through it.
Action Steps:
1.	Challenge the Norms: Question your existing recruitment practices. Are they effective? Are they limiting your pool of potential drivers?
2.	Adopt Technology: Embrace the use of AI and automation in your hiring process. Use them to streamline processes, broaden your search, and facilitate better decision-making.
3.	Focus on the Person, Not Just the Driver: Look beyond driving skills and qualifications. Assess attitudes, values, and potential. Remember, you're hiring a person, not just a driver.
4.	Learn and Adapt: Stay updated with industry trends, technological advancements, and best practices. Learn from others and be willing to adapt your processes accordingly.
5.	Share Your Insights: Don't keep your learnings to yourself. Share them with others in the industry. Remember, we're in this together.

Embrace AI and automation to revolutionize recruitment, skyrocket success! Say goodbye to endless cycles, unlock seamless and efficient driver recruitment. 💪 #FutureOfRecruitment #AIRevolution 🌟🚀",Introduction,"Picture this: A time in the not-so-distant future where job applications are screened, shortlisted, interviewed, and hired, not by human beings, but by artificial intelligence. Frightening...? Maybe. But we live in a time when technology advances at an unprecedented pace. 
In my early career running a truck driver recruiting firm, I grappled with one significant problem – the inability to recruit and retain qualified drivers effectively. The situation was like a revolving door, with drivers coming in and going out just as quickly. Despite our reputation and competitive compensation packages, the constant cycle of hiring and losing drivers was disheartening and expensive.
Driven by the need to find a solution, I took a deep dive into emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence and advanced automation. It was a world I knew little about in 2019 when I found out about it at a Forbes Speaking event. From that day I was determined to become an expert at using it. My first project was to use AI and automation to automate the sales process. To do that, build a growth engine. My discoveries transformed our recruitment processes. When I created a recruitment engine that supercharged my recruiting results. Making me #1 Recruitment and Retention Strategist for trucking and logistics. While positioning our company at the forefront of a new era of data-driven recruitment.
The transformation took time; there were thousands of tests done. With lots of hurdles and tons of resistance. Yet, as time went by, the results were undeniable. We saw an increase in the quality of applicants, a reduction in the time taken to fill vacancies, and, most importantly, a significant improvement in driver retention rates. I then realized we were merely scratching the surface of what AI-powered recruitment could offer.
As I pen this chapter, the world is witnessing an AI arms race. Global superpowers are investing billions into research and development, keen on harnessing the power of AI to their advantage. The unfolding scenario isn't unlike what was portrayed in Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina,” where AI was the unseen hand controlling human destiny. While the movie painted a somewhat dystopian future, in reality, the potential of AI holds promises, especially in the field of recruitment and retention.
In this chapter, we will navigate through the future of AI in recruitment. We will delve into the upcoming trends in AI and automation and explore the challenges and opportunities these present. We will reflect on my forward-thinking approach and preparations for the future. And finally, we'll draw insights from Kai-Fu Lee's ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" and the ethical considerations of AI advancements as we dive into the thrilling world of AI recruitment and retention.
The promise here is not just to forecast the future but also to prepare you to harness it. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer understanding of the upcoming trends, potential challenges, and how to strategically position yourself to ride the AI wave in recruitment and retention to success. With a fully staffed drivers’ team and support staff. Where you can spend your time doing your job versus always putting out fires because you are short-staffed. 
Now, shall we venture into the future?
Section 1 - Future Trends in AI and Automation for Recruitment (800 words)
The future of AI in recruitment is laden with advancements and possibilities that stretch our imaginations. We are witnessing the emergence of an age where machines perform mundane tasks and make sophisticated decisions, learn, and adapt over time. This evolution of AI and automation is reshaping the recruitment and retention landscape in ways we never thought possible.
One of the most significant trends is the rise of powerful CRM, recruitment, sales, and marketing advanced automation platforms, which can create rules for how the software is used so it is personalized to fit your company’s needs. Repeatable tasks are automated with decision logic, bringing efficiency to your recruitment team so you can scale and grow. Managers, in particular, benefit from the system's Check and Balance rules because the software automatically informs the management team when business processes are not being followed or are not on schedule, giving time to execute a backup plan to ensure deadlines aren't missed. AI Data-Driven Recruitment, which creates a funnel report to track and measure conversions, allowing your company to optimize for predictable and repeatable results. Advanced predictive analytics identify and address problems before they occur and supply real-time data and insights for improving processes.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants in recruitment. They are no longer the clunky, rule-based programs they once were. With advancements in natural language processing, these bots can engage candidates in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and even conduct preliminary interviews. Moreover, they operate 24/7, significantly reducing the response time and enhancing the candidate’s experience.
Another trend set to redefine recruitment is predictive analytics. Imagine if you could accurately predict a candidate's job performance and likelihood to leave the role even before you hire them. Advanced AI algorithms can do exactly that. These algorithms can generate predictive insights that will guide hiring decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data - from a candidate's application, social media profiles, and online behavior.
AI's ability to sift through massive datasets extends to the realm of talent sourcing as well. Intelligent sourcing tools can scour the internet to identify potential candidates who might not even be actively seeking a job change. These ""passive candidates"" are often high-quality talents who could be perfect fits for your roles, yet would have been overlooked by traditional recruitment methods.
The automation of administrative tasks is a trend that continues to gain momentum. Consider the manual processes involved in recruitment - scheduling interviews, sending reminders, collating feedback, and updating databases. Each of these tasks, while seemingly small, adds up to a substantial portion of a recruiter's time. AI-powered tools can automate these processes, allowing recruiters to focus on the more strategic aspects of their roles.
There is also a growing focus on creating a more personalized candidate experience. Just like how AI is used to personalize online shopping or content recommendations, it is being used to deliver personalized employer brands, recruitment messaging, and application processes. This heightened level of personalization enhances candidate experience and strengthens your employer’s brand, increasing your company’s intrinsic value.
Finally, we are seeing the rise of AI tools that are capable of unbiased decision-making. One of the biggest criticisms of AI in recruitment and retention is the potential for algorithmic bias. However, advancements in machine learning techniques have led to the development of tools that can eliminate unconscious biases, delivering a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
It's a tantalizing future that holds tremendous potential for those willing to embrace the power of AI and automation. However, just like any significant shift, it does not come without its challenges. As we continue our journey, let's delve into these potential roadblocks and discuss how we can navigate them.
Section 3 - Thinking Approach and Preparations for the Future 
Throughout my journey of becoming the # 1 recruitment and retention strategist in the trucking and logistics industry, I've learned that the best way to prepare for the future is to be the architect of it. Rather than sitting back and waiting for change to come, I've strived to actively seek out and shape the future I envision. This mindset has been instrumental in my preparations for the AI-led future of recruitment and retention.
One of the critical aspects of my approach is continuous learning. The world of AI and automation is vast and constantly evolving. 
To keep up, I dedicate time to learn about the latest advancements, trends, and best practices in the industry. I regularly attend webinars, participate in forums, and read extensively. This thirst for knowledge allows me to stay updated and make informed decisions.
In addition to self-learning, I place a high emphasis on collaboration. My friends and associates are some of the leading experts in AI and advanced automation in the online sales process. I believe that the best ideas are born out of the fusion of diverse perspectives. So, I regularly engage with industry experts, attend networking events, and collaborate with technology vendors. These interactions provide insights that are valuable in shaping my understanding and approach to AI recruitment and retention. 
Experimentation and testing is another key element of my approach. I view every new technology or tool as an opportunity to learn and grow. While some experiments have resulted in great success, others have taught me valuable lessons. This culture of experimentation encourages innovation and resilience, both vital traits in navigating the uncertain terrain of the future.
Beyond staying updated and experimenting, I've also invested in building a robust technological infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, and a team of experts to manage and optimize these systems. I've learned that technology is not just about buying the latest tools; it's about creating an environment where these tools can thrive and deliver maximum value. To the people you hire. Your recruitment team and profits for the company. 
Perhaps most importantly, my preparations for the future are rooted in empathy. People are at the heart of recruitment, and any technology we deploy should enhance their experience, not diminish it. Whether it's an AI chatbot that makes job applications more accessible or a predictive analytics tool for better reporting, the focus is always on creating a positive and inclusive candidate experience.
Lastly, ethical considerations guide my preparations. As we venture deeper into the realm of AI and automation, we must be vigilant about potential ethical issues. This could range from data privacy concerns to algorithmic biases. By adopting an ethical approach, I aim to create a recruitment process that respects individual rights, fosters fairness, and promotes inclusivity.
I believe that the future of AI in recruitment is not something to fear but rather to embrace. It promises to transform recruitment and retention from a labor-intensive, subjective process to a streamlined, data-driven one. However, this transformation can only happen when we are prepared for it.
As we journey into this future, drawing insights from those who have been at the forefront of AI advancements is crucial. In the next section, we'll dive into the insights gleaned from Kai-Fu Lee's book and the ethical considerations highlighted in ""Ex Machina"".
Section 4 - Insight from the Reference Book and Movie, Focusing on the Global Impact and Ethical Considerations of AI Advancements
As we envision the future of AI in recruitment and retention, it is enlightening to draw on the wisdom of thought leaders in this field. Kai-Fu Lee's book ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order"" provides a striking perspective on AI's potential. Meanwhile, the movie ""Ex Machina"" subtly yet powerfully explores the ethical dilemmas associated with AI advancements.
Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent figure in AI research and investment, paints a picture of a world where AI will shape economies and societies. He underscores that AI's impact will be felt far beyond the confines of technology companies. It will penetrate sectors as diverse as healthcare, education, retail, and of course, recruitment and retention.
The rise of AI, according to Lee, will necessitate a shift in our skills and attitudes. Routine, manual tasks are increasingly being automated, forcing us to adapt and retrain. In the context of recruitment, this resonates with the movement towards automated administrative tasks, allowing recruiters to focus more on strategy, relationship-building, and decision-making.
However, Lee's vision also comes with a cautionary note. As AI takes center stage, we must guard against the potential for misuse. Data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases are legitimate concerns we must proactively address. Therefore, a vigilant and ethical approach is critical, like the one we discussed earlier.
This ethical dilemma is even more vividly illustrated in the film ""Ex Machina"". Through the captivating narrative of an AI-powered humanoid robot, the film delves into the complex ethical considerations of AI. It underscores that as we develop machines with human-like intelligence and capabilities, we need to treat them with the same respect and fairness that we afford to fellow humans.
Translating this into the context of AI in recruitment, we realize the importance of treating our candidates fairly, irrespective of AI’s role in recruitment. An AI tool should not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or any other personal attribute. Instead, it should assess each candidate based on their skills, experience, and job fit.
The movie also touches on the importance of transparency in AI. As the protagonist interacts with the AI robot, he's oblivious to the extent of her capabilities and intentions, leading to catastrophic consequences. In the realm of AI recruitment, this highlights the importance of being transparent with our candidates about the role of AI in the recruitment process. Candidates should know when they are interacting with an AI, what data the AI is collecting, and how it will be used.
By synthesizing these insights from the book and the movie, we gain a holistic perspective on the future of AI in recruitment. It is a future that holds immense promise, provided we navigate it with learning, adaptation, ethics, and transparency.

Section 5 - Conclusion and Action Steps
The world of human resources, and people operations is on the precipice of an AI revolution, a transformative period that will forever change how we attract, recruit, and retain talent. As we venture into this exciting but uncertain future, it's imperative to seize the opportunities, mitigate the challenges, and uphold the highest ethical standards.
Our exploration in this chapter has revealed that far from being soulless machines, AI and automation can emulate and even enhance the human touch in recruitment. They free us from administrative burdens, equip us with deep insights, enable personalized engagement, and contribute to a fairer recruitment process.
However, this doesn't make our role as recruiters any less significant. It makes it more important than before. It raises the bar for what we can and should do. With AI taking care of routine tasks, we can devote ourselves to recruitment's higher-level, strategic aspects. We can craft compelling employer stories that no AI can tell, foster the personal connections that no AI can form, and make the complex, nuanced decisions that no AI can master. We are the humanity in recruitment technology.
As we look to the future, it's clear that the lines between man and machine will continue to blur. AI will continue evolving, becoming more sophisticated, and becoming even more integrated into our work. Yet, amidst this technological revolution, the human element of recruitment will remain vital.
The future of AI in recruitment isn't about replacing humans with machines. It’s about Hybrid AI. Hybrid AI is leveraging the best of human intelligence with the best of artificial intelligence. Where humans make the final hiring decision. We use both strengths to create an efficient, effective, and equitable recruitment process. And it's about doing so while remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls, mindful of ethical considerations, and committed to transparency.
Action Steps:
1.	Get familiar with AI technologies: Begin your journey into AI-powered recruitment by familiarizing yourself with the available tools and technologies. Take a few online courses, attend webinars, or consult with AI technology providers to get a grasp of the basics.
2.	Assess your needs and resources: Before you dive into implementing AI in your recruitment process, assess your organization's needs and resources. What tasks could benefit from automation? Do you have the budget for a sophisticated AI solution? What kind of training would your staff require to use AI tools effectively?
3.	Choose the right AI solution: When choosing an AI tool, look beyond the marketing hype. Focus on its practical capabilities, data privacy measures, and adaptability to your needs. Request a demo or a trial period to see the tool in action.
4.	Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate with your candidates about the role of AI in your recruitment process. Make sure they understand when they're interacting with an AI, what data the AI collects, and how this data will be used.
5.	Monitor and refine: The implementation of AI in recruitment is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly monitor the performance of your AI tools, gather feedback from users and candidates, and refine your approach accordingly.
